I heard their peculiar talking\nbefore I saw them. The Gallinule was swimming in\nclear water near some grass. The Teal were all males\nin full plumage. They were too shy to permit me\nto approach within shot. I fired shots at a Grebe\nbut missed. While driving around this pond Bingo\nmade a point on the edge of an impenetrable\nthicket of greenbriars. Two Quail flirted up & dropped\nagain before I could shoot; I heard others walking\non the leaves. ""Bingo"" would not enter the thicket.\nWe found the next bevy on a hillside among dense\nbroom sedge and young pines. ""Bingo"" came off his\npoint, found us, and then led me back. The birds\nrose wild and I missed with both barrels. They took\nto the woods where I could not find them again.\n""Bingo"" soon after found a bevy in wild plum\nbushes in a deep hollow. I made a double as they rose.\nWillis failed to mark the survivors but I finally started\nfive in some pines & missed a high shot at them.\nThe last covey found to-day was lying among some sprouts\nof a young live oak in a ploughed field. They rose wild\n& I fired only one barrel getting my bird. One of them\nalighted in a furrow in the field but neither the dog\nnor I could flush him. I finished the day by\nkilling two Snipe & missing two others on the edge of\na pond where I shot at a pair of ducks on the 18th.\nBirds singing freely early this morning. Heard Cardinals,\nMockers, Bluebirds & about 5 Towhees probably P[ipilo]\nerythrophthalmus. Saw many Meadow Larks in flocks all\nsilent. Purple Martins about gourds near the negro cabins.","274","",""

At others they merely drifted in\na compact line looking exactly like a black log.\nThey rose at frequent intervals and mounting high\nin air circled and wheeled for many minutes at\na time, flying miles before re-alighting, and uttering their\nwild, jingling chorus of ""sleigh-bell"" cries.

When they set their wings\nand descended towards the Lake they made a\nsound like a gale of wind blowing through the\nwoods or perhaps more like escaping steam. This\nwas distinctly audible a mile away.\n  On the water they frequently executed a sort of\nrevolving dance, the whole flock swimming rapidly in\na circle, each bird using his paddles so vigorously as\nto keep most of his body above the surface. This\nperformance made a plashing sound like heavy\nrain on a still pond. During it they did not\nuse their wings at all. Occasionally but rarely, a\nsingle bird would rise on end and flap his wings\nlike a Loon. Almost incessantly one or more birds were\ngoing through a motion which seem to be peculiar\nto Scoters if not to the single species O. americana.\nThis motion is difficult to describe. The bird seems\nto raise the entire forward half of his body out of the\nwater and lengthening his neck stretches it straight\nupward presenting nearly the appearance of a bottle\nfloating with its neck upright.
