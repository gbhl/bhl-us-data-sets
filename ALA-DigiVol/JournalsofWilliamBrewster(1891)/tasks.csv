But\ndespite their foulness, despite the sad inroads\nmade by the brickyards and the constantly\nincreasing traffic over the two railroads which\npierce this innermost recesses they possess for\nme a charm which grows rather than wanes\nas the year go by. Its secret is largely, of course,\nthe abundant and interesting bird-life which\nhas certainly suffered no serious check since\nthe new order of things began. Indeed it is\ndoubtful if in the old days, at least as far\nback as my memory goes, there was ever a\nseason when so many birds, whether taken as\nspecies or individuals, bred in these swamps\nas in 1890. This year the Rails are much\nscarcer and there are apparently no Gallinules\nor Least Bitterns but obviously this is due\nto some other cause than the presence of the\nbrickyards ad railroads.
