It's presence there would not have been surprising,\nbut the fact that it fell from the wall aroused my \nsuspicions and retiring a few rods I watched the \nwall closely. In a few moments a weasel, of the larger \nkind, in its brown summer pilage glided out, seized\nthe mouse by the nape, and made off, appearing and \ndisappearing between the stones of the wall along which\nit pursued its way with surprising speed.\n  I started at least six or eight rabbitts (L. Sylvaticus) \nin the bush-grown openings and pasture edges. They\nnearly all uttered a low, but clear whistling cry as they\nsprang from their fawns. The only birds seen in any \nnumbers were Dendroica pennsylvanica, Seiurus auricapillus\nand Virio olivaceus. Of Minotilta varia, Hel ruficapilla\nand Turdus fuscipeus, I heard only one each.
