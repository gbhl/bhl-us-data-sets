This attractive\nlittle oasis certainly possesses a remarkable bird fauna. As we\nwere eating lunch under the shade of the oaks I made the\nfollowing list. Turdus sivainsoni, 1 [male] singing; Merula migratoria, several;\nDendroica aestiva, about 6 [male] [male]; D. striata, 1 [male]; Setophaga ruticilla, 3 [male] [male]; \nVireo olivaceus, several [male] [male]; Melospiza meloda*[melodia], 3 [male] [male]; Icterus baltimore, 1 [male];\nAgelaius phoeniceus, 3 [male] [male]; Quiscalus aeneus, six or eight; Contopus virens,\n1 singing; Passer domesticus, legions. Besides these two Meadow Larks\ncould be just heard in the distance. No Oven Birds of M.Yellow throats.\n[margin] Oak Island\nbird fauna[/margin]\n  Searching the marshes carefully to the westward of the Island\nwe got another Sharp-tail which Faxon shot among sedge on \nthe edge of a creek. It proved to be an interesting specimen, \napparently intermediate between caudacutus & [suberigatus?].\n  On our way back to Oak Island station we were luckily tempted\nto investigate some attractive looking Sharp-tail ground - a series of\nsmall salt ponds bordered by narrow strips of bleached, dead grass in\na little meadow S.E. of the Island. Scarcely had we entered this place\nwhen a Sparrow flew from the top of a stake where it had been \nsitting & pitched into the grass. Faxon shot it and we found it\nto be a typical caudacutus. In the course of a few hundred yards\nfurther we started at least five more all of which were unmistakeably\nof the same form. They were shyer than the [suberigatus?], flew much \nmore freely & further, and looked as dark as Savanna Sparrows. This \nis probably the place where Brackett killed his birds seven or eight years ago.\n[margin]Colony of\nA caudauctus[/margin]\n  Returned to Boston by 4.57 P.M. train.","150","",""
