For this particular project, we're pushing the transcriptions to a game that's being developed to reconcile multiple transcriptions from the same page. Thus, the programmers at Missouri Botanical Garden want transcripts with as few non-alpha characters as possible. Thus, we have limited cases where square brackets are required, so we're not worrying about misspellings at this point. Misspelled words may be transcribed exactly as Brewster wrote them, even though our inclination is to correct them, or flag them in some way. Plus it saves a little work for the transcriber! \nThanks very much for your help!"

It was an old white\npine with a hollow twenty feet or more above the\nground. Quantities of comb lay scattered about on\nthe ground and a number of yellow jacket hornets\nwere clustered on it. There were also some dead\nhoney bees sticking to the comb and a few live ones\nwere going in & out the hole in the pine.\n  At the foot of the hill we stopped to look at\na fine, tall pine and were standing nearly under\nit talking when a Great Horned Owl flew\nfrom one of its lower branches (a dead branch)\nand flapped swiftly & silently off through the\ntrees. I have rarely got so near one of these Owls\nin the daytime. No pellets or other signs under the tree.\n[margin]Great Horned Owl[/margin]\n  The woods on Bristen's Hill over Fairyland are\nthe finest by far that I have ever seen in this\ncountry. Evidently the land has never been cleared\n& the woods doubtless show what the original\nforest of this region was like. There are very\nmany tall oaks among the pines, a few hemlocks,\nsome large canoe birches (one 42 inches in girth),\na few yellow birches & at least one black","434","",""

Birds appeared unusually numerous\nfor the season probably because the mild weather\ntempted them out of the woods to the thickets\n& isolated trees along the rim or partly, perhaps,\nbecause the still, damp air brought the sound\nof their voices from exceptionally great distances.\nI heard or saw a Red-shouldered Hawk (a\nfine adult perched in a tree near the rim)\nfive or six Blue Jays, a flock of five Tree Sparrows","458","",""
