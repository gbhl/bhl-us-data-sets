# bhl-us-data-sets
This repository contains archives of data sets collected by projects related to the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL).  The data sets are hosted here so that anyone who wants to make use of the data has access to it.

The presense of a data set in this repository does not guarantee that BHL is making active use of it.  The data may have been incorporated into the main BHL database, it may be incorporated at a later date, or it may simply be maintained for historical purposes.

For detailed information about a particular data set, see the README file found in the data set's folder.
