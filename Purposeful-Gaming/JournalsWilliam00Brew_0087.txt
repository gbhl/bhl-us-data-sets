Winchendon, Massachusetts
Clear and warmer. Wind S. W.
  Rose early and got off for the woods about 8 A. M. going
down the road. Birds singing freely on every side. In the
willow run heard a Golden-winged Warbler. On the edge
of the spruce swamp two Parulas, two D. blackburniae, several
D. virens and a Regulus satrapa were in full song. 
  Watching the Kinglet closely I soon detected its mate which
I resolved to follow to her nest. This proved a tedious
task but at length I saw her go several times in
succession into the top of a tall slender spruce. This
Bailey climbed & examined closely but failed to find
anything. Shortly after he had descended, however, the
Kinglets returned and we saw the [female] repeatedly go
into the tree with her bill filled with some white,
fluffy substance. She would almost immediately reappear
and start for another load. Her motions were very
quick and nervous. At one time there were three Kinglets
in the tree, two of them [females] I think.
  Hearing a Solitary bird sing several times in the same
place I started in search of the nest which I found
very quickly in a small hemlock near the edge of the
swamp. It held three eggs slightly incubated. The [female] was
shy starting off at ten yards and going straight off
among the trees but I saw her distinctly nevertheless.
  Denton made the next find, a nest of D. virens
with four fresh eggs. It was in a spruce sapling near
the road.
  In these woods we heard two Red Crossbills and I
shot one of them, a [male] in partie-colored plumage. The
other I did not see.
  Several Canada Warblers were singing in the swamp
