648 VITALITY AND EFFICIENCY WITH RESTRICTED DIET. 
about evenly divided in their make-up between men who were 
taking the course in physical education and those who were taking 
the secretarial course. As a matter of fact, Squad A had, excluding 
Fre, 7 men taking the physical course and 5 taking the secretarial 
course, while with Squad B, 9 were taking the physical course and 3 
the secretarial course. Undue prominence, however, should not be 
given to this classification, for it is by no means sure that the activities 
of the men taking the physical course were very much, if any, greater 
than those of the subjects taking the secretarial course. 
COMPARISON OF PEDOMETER RECORDS, SQUAD A, WITH THOSE FOR SQUAD B 
ON NORMAL DIET. 
The normal values obtained for Squad B are recorded in the first line of 
table 193, with an average of 6.24 miles per day. Comparing this average 
value, obtained when the subjects were on normal diet, with those 
obtained with Squad A on reduced diet (see table 192) it can be seen that 
this is not far from a roughly average figure shown by the latter squad. 
If anything, it is slightly lower than those obtained when Squad A was 
at maintenance level, namely, December 13 to 19, and the latter part of 
January. We believe that this is tolerably good evidence that Squad 
A was not exercising less, at least so far as the pedometer records are 
concerned, than the average college student of the undergraduate 
body. Emphasis should again be laid upon the fact that Squad B was 
on normal diet, as the men were not put upon reduced rations until 
January 8. The evidence, therefore, as supplied by the pedometer 
records, is clearly to the effect that Squad A, after the first two weeks, 
maintained a level of walking which was perfectly comparable, even 
when on low diet, to that maintained by Squad B on a normal diet 
with very much larger energy content. 
While the closest attempt to secure quantitative measurements of 
physical activity by means of pedometers leads to the above findings, 
yet, in View of the defective nature of the pedometer units, an analysis 
of the probable physical activities, particularly those other than walk- 
ing, is essential before the final decision can be made as to whether or 
not Squad A materially altered their physical activity as compared 
to that of the average undergraduate in the Y. M. C. A. College. 
PEDOMETER RECORDS FOR SQUAD B WITH REDUCED DIET. 
The pedometer records for Squad B are given in table 193, together 
with the normal values obtained on December 13 to 19. In considering 
these, it is important to bear in mind that the observations made on 
Squad B comprise solely those during a transitional period. The 
average number of miles during the first week of reduced diet is prac- 
tically uniform with that on normal diet, but the pronounced fall in 
the subsequent two values is worthy of emphasis and is clearly to be 
ascribed to the very severe reduction in diet which took place.
