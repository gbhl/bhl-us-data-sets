seen or heard in the heart of the city. 
A few White-throats chirping and several
Yellow-rumps both yesterday & to-day. A
Cardinal this morning in full song, a
fine performer calling rita-rita-rita rita
rita with great clearness and in peculiarly
tender tones. Heard Mocking-birds giving
the smacking kiss note and saw one
perched on the ridge pole of a house the
wind giving him much trouble with his
long tail but [now?] [even?] singing. English
Sparrows very numerous & noisy wheras last
year they were scarcer
  Visited the market early in the forenoon.
Only about a dozen Vultures there. The
market men assured me that they are
not less numerous than formerly but
their numbers vary greatly at the
market on different days.
  Besides the species just mentioned heard
& saw Fish Crows flying over the city.
Did not visit the Battery to look after 
the Gulls & Terns.
  The city gardens are filled with a 
profusion of roses, violets, [azaleas?] and
various other flowers. There has been
almost no frost here this year & 
the flowers have bloomed unintermittently.
It was odd to see snow-drops, crocuses &
hyacinths blooming side by side with roses
nasturtiums & calendulas.
