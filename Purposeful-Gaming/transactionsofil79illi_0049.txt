SEVENTH ANNUAL MEETING 43 
ably dawned upon the pupil's comprehension, if at all, long 
after high school days were over. The causes of this lack of 
articulation were at least two : the teacher and the text-book. 
There exists in the minds of certain members of this com- 
mittee, as probably has been stated at a previous meeting, a 
very admirable conception of a high school science teaching 
which will break down and clear away the barriers which have 
been the jealous boundaries of each man's domain ;which will 
interweave the materials, the methods, and the facts of all the 
sciences into a fabric so smooth that a pupil entering upon 
the science course of a curriculum will find less difficulty in 
beginning new subjects each year and hence will be more apt 
to complete the entire course. Such a course has been well 
marked out in English. English now is a four-year unit and 
no longer solitary, independent units; the course is working 
excellently. In such a course the materials and information 
from one laboratory will be utilized in the others. The chem- 
ical, physical, biological, and geographical materials will be 
unified. 
For example : A zoology or physiology class, when study- 
ing the animal eye, will begin with a simple lens, determina- 
tion of principle and secondary foci, and image formation, 
and from this physical basis work into the use of a retina. This 
material used again in the physics laboratory, will give point 
or application to a cold law of optics or refraction. 
And throughout the course materials of study will be inter- 
changed and utilized until the pupil realizes that no phenome- 
non is to itself alone, but that all unite to make the whole. In 
such a course it may even come about that instead of the 
name plates on laboratory doors and in catalogs being called 
"Chemistry," or "Geography," they will be "Third Year Sci- 
ence," and "First Year Science." 
In conclusion, then, may it be stated that by "unified sci- 
ence" is not meant a uniform, standardized, "cut and dried" 
course for all teachers, all classes and all localities, but a science 
the parts of which are not integers but fractions, not isolated 
subjects taught by trained specialists, but are portions of a 
broad (or deep) subject, science, taught by men who specialize 
in the general education of youth.
