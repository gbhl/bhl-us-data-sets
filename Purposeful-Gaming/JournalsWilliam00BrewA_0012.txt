  Following the beach back to 
Oak Island we came upon a flock
of about forty Redpolls feeding on
the seeds of golden rods. I fired a
barrel into them getting seven, and
afterwards a second shot at long
range which failed to bring down
any. Chadbourne killed one. All
eight were linaria and not one in
rosy-breasted plumage.

  Near Atlantic we found two
Song Sparrows on the edge of a creek
behind a barn in some tall [hedge?].
Returned to the city by the 3.53 train.

  (Next day (Feb.12) I saw at Goodale
and Frazar's three Evening Grosbeaks (a
[male] & two [females]) which were shot at
Crescent Beach on the afternoon of
the 11th and hence probably while
we were at or near Atlantic, a station
less than half-a-mile from Crescent
Beach. I remember hearing two shots
in the direction of the latter place
at about 3 o'clock)
