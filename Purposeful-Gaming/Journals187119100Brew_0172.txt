1886
Aug. 15
Concord, Massachusetts.
  (Sunday) Clear and cool with high N. W. wind.
  In the afternoon sailed up river to 
Fairhaven Bay paddling back; leaving the Manse
at 3 o'clock, sailing about the bay for an hour
(5 to 6 o'clock), returning at sunset (6 to 7 o'clock).

  On the way up saw but few birds and heard
singing only two Maryland Yellow-Throats. At [?]
bay heard two more Yellow-Throats, two Cuckoos
(C.erythropthalmus) and an Oriole, all singing.

  A Black Duck, the first of the season, passed
low over the bay quaking at intervals.

  As I approached the landing at the base of 
Fairhaven Hill the Turtle Dove which I have
seen and heard there to many times this 
summer flew from the pines and crossing
the river alighted in an apple tree; a moment
later it few down to the river bank and 
began drinking immersing its bill nearly to the 
eyes like a [?] pigeon.  I paddled to within
20 yds. of it when it raised its head, bobbed 
it once or twice, then flew its wings whistling
loudly. As it stood erect first before starting
the setting free touched its breast singing it a 
deep warm red.

  A few rods below her two Wood Ducks settled
among the City pads. I paddled within 20 yds.
of them before they saw me and flew one
of them carrying off a good-used object,
apparently a piece of lily root, in its bill. One 
of them uttered the usual Canary -like pee-e-e.
