  Clear but windy and
cold. Ther. about 30[degrees] - 48[degrees] - 
30[degrees] . Rose as usual.
Attended church in
A.M. and walked up
with the R's.
  After dinner Mr. D.
called and we walked
first up to Watertown to
Mr. Stickneys where his
sick horse is, and then
down to Barnes's in
Brighton but the latter
was out.
  Got home by 5 P.M. and
went to bed at 8.30.
  The leaves in the swamps
are now all down, but in
spite of the hard frosts the
oaks, birches, maples, beeches
and the apple trees of the uplands
still thick with foliage which
in sheltered places, is as green
as ever.

  Clear and very cold. Ther.
about 19[degrees] - 45[degrees] - 36[degrees].
Rose at 4.45 A.M. and
went down to the pond.
At daybreak C. Chenerry who
was the only other boat out, 
started four large ducks.
Then I tried to creep on to a
wounded Rubida but failed.
At 9 A.M. two Scaups came
in and I killed one. Chased
the other for a long time but lost
him. Upon coming home found
Henshaw waiting for me. We
went out on the farm and I
took Zon. Albicollis, two [female]; T.
Pallasii two; Regulus Satrapa [male];
H. got about the same numbers
and variety. Spent the rest
of the day in skinning these
and a Woodcock shot last Monday.
Zon. Albicollis, still abundant.
Plec. Nivalis, heard the first
of the season.
