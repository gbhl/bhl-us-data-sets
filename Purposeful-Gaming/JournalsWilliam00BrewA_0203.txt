1890
July 31
Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts
A gale from the S.W. all the afternoon but after sunset only a fresh 
breeze. After dinner got my canoe ready and at 6 P.M. started
for the South Beach. I paddled about a mile along the shore,
hearing Savanna Sparrows & Yellow-wings singing at intervals
& seeing a few Spotted Sandpipers, when Mr Bailey overtook me
in a large sail boat & offered to tow me to the beach an 
offer which I gladly accepted. Landed near the beacon to see
the surf which was very fine. Then, shortly after the moon
rose, I paddled up to the head of the bay near Katama
and went ashore for the night. As I skirted the beach
I heard Least Terns in the air constantly & occasionally
made one out dimly. I also heard them at intervals 
during the entire night. A few Night Herons came about
my canoe at intervals & I heard a Greater Yellow-leg about
daybreak.
Aug 1
Cloudy with occasional short intervals of sunshine and a
heavy thunder shower preceeded*[preceded] by a gale of wind at about
6 A.M. Wind N.E. to E. most of the day.
  At daybreak heard Greater Yellow-legs and Upland Plover
calling, Night Herons quaking, and the shrill cries of Terns.
Also many small waders. Just after rising (about 7 A.M.) a 
heavy thunder shower passed over the [?] upsetting the 
canoe. Immediately after the shower there was a short
period of dead calm during which I heard a cuckoo,
a Maryland Yellow-throat & several Towhees singing in
the oak scrub across the bay near Katama.
  As the tide rose numerous waders began flying along
the shore many alighting near me. There were great
numbers of Red-breasted Snipe, Turnstones, Least &
Semipalmated Sandpipers, Sandling, [delete]and[/delete] Ring-necked and
