1886
May 7
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and warm. Wind S.W. in the afternoon
S.E.
  Paddled up the Assabet in the forenoon.
Birds were rather numerous, and I noted
several arrivals; Dolichonyx, a single male
in full song; Geothlypis trichas, several singing;
and Virio olivaceus a single male singing.
  The Apple orchards are in nearly full
bloom to-day and as usual, filled with honey
bees humming loudly.
