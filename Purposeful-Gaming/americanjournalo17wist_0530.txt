10. On the right side: the lower half of the coronal, the whole 
of the masto-occipital suture. On the left side: the coronal 
suture and partly the masto-occipital suture. 
11. On the right side: the masto-occipital and masto-parietal 
suture. On the left side: the hinder part of the squamosal, the 
masto-parietal and masto-occipital suture. 
12. The sutura sagittalis. On the right side: the masto- 
occipital suture; on the left side the lower half of the coronal, 
the masto-parietal and masto-occipital suture. 
Amongst the skulls of Group III, the following case was 
found : 
13. On the right side: the whole of the squamosal and the 
masto-occipital sutures. On the left side: the masto-occipital 
suture. 
Amongst the infantile skulls of Group IV, the following cases 
were found : 
14. On the right side: the hinder part of the squamosal and 
the masto-occipital suture; on the left side: the squamosal, 
masto-parietal and masto-occipital sutures. 
15. The sutura sagittalis. On the right and left side: the 
spheno-parietal, the masto-parietal and masto-occipital sutures. 
Amongst the skulls of Group V I found the following cases : 
16. The sutura sagittalis partially on the right and left side: 
a hinder part of the squamosal and the masto-parietal sutures. 
17. On the right side: the posterior half of the squamosal, 
the masto-parietal, the masto-occipital sutures. On the left 
side as on the right, and moreover the lower half of the lambdoidal 
suture. 
Amongst the skulls of Group VII I found the following case: 
18. The sutura sagittalis partially. On the right side: the 
masto-occipital suture. On the left side: the posterior half of 
the squamosal, the masto-parietal and the masto-occipital 
suture. The number of non-adult skulls in which the premature 
obliteration of the sutures assumes an irregular character on a 
larger scale amounts to 1 per cent (18 skulls amongst 1820). 
When examining these cases more closely, and seeking to deter- 
mine the question in which suture the greatest amount of ob-
