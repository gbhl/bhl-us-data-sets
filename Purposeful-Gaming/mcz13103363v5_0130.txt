Tuesday, September 7, 1869.
  Clear and exceedingly 
warm. Ther. about
70[degrees] - 80[degrees] - 70[degrees]. Woke
at daylight feeling
very sick. Took a dose
of rhubarb and kept
my bed all the morning.
In the afternoon felt
better and took a
ride down to the
old place with father
and saw the Russells.
R. Deane and E.
Dodge callled in the
evening and stayed
till 10 P.M.
  The leaves have not
turned in the least,
as yet.
Wednesday, September 8, 1869.
  Alternately cloudy and
clear. Had several heavy
showers in A.M. In P.M.
rained hard all the
time and blew a perfect
hurricane till dark
tearing up trees by the
roots, blowing down
chimneys and towers
and in fact doing all
sorts of damage.
Felt rather better to-
day but I am still
far from well.
  Spent most of A.M.
in reading and of
the afternoon in
sleeping.
