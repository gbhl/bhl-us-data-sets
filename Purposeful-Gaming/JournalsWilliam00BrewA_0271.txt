a fine young [male] Bald-pate (Mareca).
  After eating lunch we started back for the boat. 
On the way Don worked off on the track of
something and we soon heard him bark in the
distance. The guides both ran to the spot and
found him rolling on the ground in great
agony with his nose, lips and the roof of his mouth
literally bristling with Porcupine quills. M. fortunately
had a pair of small tweezers in a combination
knife and with these we quickly extracted the quills
but one had worked completely through his
nose from beneath. He bore the pain with
wonderful fortitude whining a little and wagging
his tail incessantly.

  Next tried Curtis Meadow. No Ducks there.

Rowed back to the Lake. Near the Magalloway
a Great Horned Owl flew across the river alternately

flapping and scaling like a Buteo. It was
getting dark as we neared the Outlet and we
heard two Snipe flying about. Also saw
three Black Ducks alight. I tried to walk out
to them but they saw me and flew.

  Very few small birds in the woods today.
There are almost no Blue Jays this year
and practically no small Woodpeckers. In fact
the woods are dreary and lifeless although

not half the leaves have as yet fallen.
Heard two Great Horned Owls hooting
near Moll's Carry as we were on the marsh
after the Ducks. One hooted in a higher key
than the other and had an additional note.
Hoo, ho-ho-ho, hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo. They were near together
and probably a pair.
