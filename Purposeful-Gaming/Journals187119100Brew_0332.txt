1887                                              
July 25
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and warm with strong S.W. wind,
  Down river by boat with C. at 10 a.m. spending
the day.
  Sailed to Ball's Hill when we landed and
passed the forenoon and the early afternoon
continuing on to Len Davis' Hill late in the afternoon
and rowing home at sunset.
  The banks and shallows of the river are now
clothed in the fullest luxuriance of midsummer
vegetation. The pickerel weed and button bush are
still in bloom but past their prime. The Fisauria
is conspicuous and abundant along the margins
of marshy places and its rice-like grain has just
begun to attract the Red-wings chattering flocks
of which, largely composed of young, undisturbed
in several places especially at the large island
of aquatic plants which is even more luxuriant
than last year. Bobolinks, too, in small flocks
ever fittering about and chink-ing musically.
The haymakers were busy along the high banks
but the meadows proper have not yet been
disturbed. They were everywhere flooded by an
unusual rise of water following the heavy rains
of the 23rd & 24th.
  The single Cistothorus Palustris was singing at the
bend of Ball's Hill. I heard no C.Stellaris
anywhere. Swallows much fewer than at this
time last year. Almost no Swifts anywhere this
season. Song Sparrows, Field Sparrows, Swamp sparrows,
Robins, Meadow Larks, Yellow Warblers and a single
Towhee, singing at sunset.
