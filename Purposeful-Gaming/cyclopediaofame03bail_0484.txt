flowers within a generation, through the work of man in turning to his 
purposes the impulses of nature, the great interest of this book may be indi- 
cated. It tells how varieties of cultivated plants come about, and further, 
how one may engage in the fascinating work of originating them. The grower 
who gropes in the dark in his search for the ideal fruit or flower may here find 
guidance and aid in the principles governing the work. 
plant-breeding comprises five chapters: The Fact and Philosophy of Variation; 
The Philosophy of the Crossing of Plants; How Domestic Varieties Originate; Bor- 
rowed Opinions, being translations from the writings of Verlot, Carriere, and focke; 
Pollination, or How to Cross Plants. Chapter iii contains the list of fifteen rules for 
plant-breeding, which De Varginy, the eminent French writer, has called "the quin- 
decalogue of the horticulturist."
