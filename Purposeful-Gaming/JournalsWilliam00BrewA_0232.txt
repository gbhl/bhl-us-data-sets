1890  
Sept 24
Lake Umbagog, Maine
  Weather very like that of yesterday but even colder and more
blustering. 
[margin]Woodcock shooting[/margin]
  Got off at the usual time with "old John" and the buckboard,
driving to the Sargent's clearing where we spent the forenoon. 
Started eight Woodcock, two in the lower end of the mixed cover
by the lake shore, four in the willows higher up, one in the spru-
ces on the hill above the road and one among the maples on the wood 
edge nearly up to Pearley White's. We killed the first two and two
of the next four, each getting two birds. I missed a shot at the 
bird in the spruces and H. one at that started among the maples. 
Don worked remarkably well making no less than seven fine points. 
The birds flew very fast and several twisted like Snipe. 
  Started two Lincoln's Finches from fine dry grass in a wet
hollow in Sargent's plantation. H. killed one flying I the other
in a brush fence where it sought shelter. I also shot a Oven-bird
and a Red-eyed Vireo the latter in a cornel where it was feeding 
on the berries.

  Saw quantities of Flickers, two bluebirds, a Pigeon Hawk, and
a flock of Rusty Blackbirds, besides a great many Sparrows. 
  Spent the afternoon beating for Snipe in the meadows at the
mouth of the Cambridge. The grounds were in good condition but we
saw no birds nor indeed any fresh signs. A single Great Blue Heron.
