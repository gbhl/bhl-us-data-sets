Lake Umbagog, Maine.
[margin]Lakeside[/margin]
  Early morning clear and cold, the ground frozen hard,
the Lake perfectly calm. As the sun rose higher
it became very warm but by eleven the sky
clouded over and a raw E. wind sprang up.
  After breakfast took my gun and Don and
beat some of the Woodcock covers near Lakeside.
Saw no Woodcock but Don found and 
pointed a Grouse in the woods E. of the
steamer landing. The bird rose wild and 
I think ["tried"?] but I could not find it.
Mr. Sweat tells me that his dog started a
Woodcock among poplars on a knoll behind
Lakeside on the 23rd inst. He saw what was
doubtless the same bird in the same place
about a week before this date.

  There were exceeding few small birds about
this morning. A few Tree Sparrows in the weed
patches on the interval, two Juncos in the
barn yard, two Creepers, several Kinglets
(satrapa) and Chickadees (atricapillus), a male
Hairy Woodpecker, a Red-bellied Nuthatch
and three Robins in the woods that I
traversed. The woods are now wholly leafless,
the fields fast turning brown, and winter
evidently very near at hand.

  Mr. Sweat tells me that several flocks of
Geese have alighted in the Lake near his
house within the past week. They have
all come in after dark and started south
before sunrise next morning. (He had a
long shot at six which flew over his farm
