Sunday, April 14, 1867.
  Clear and pleasant but the wind
veered round to the East in the
afternoon. Ther. about 32[degrees] - 48[degrees] - 40[degrees].
Went to church and Sabbath
school in A.M. In P.M. rode
over to Dorchester in P.M.
with father and stopped for
an hour or two at Mr. Worthington's
house. Got home at about 6 P.M.
and found that Dan had
been here. Read most of the
evening. There was a number
of white bellied swallows around
my boxes this morning but
they do seem to be as
numerous as they usually
are. The crocuses are in
full bloom.
Monday, April 15, 1867.
  A.M. cloudy; noon  clear; P.M.
cloudy. Blew quite hard during
the first part of the day but a
perfect hurricane in P.M. Ther.
about 45[degrees] - 70[degrees] - 60[degrees]. Rose at 5.20
A.M. and studied most of the
A.M. till breakfast. When I got
home from school finished
the kingfisher stuffed Saturday.
In P.M. took a ride up to
Lexington on my horse but she
was obstinate a number of times
& I did not get home till
about 7 P.M. On the way up
saw a yellow red-poll warbler for
the first time this year. In the
evening went up to the R's. The toads
are out. Began to advance in Cicero.
The grass is everywhere very green.
