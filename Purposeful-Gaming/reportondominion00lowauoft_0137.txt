SUMMER CRUISE 65 
about five miles farther up on the same side, opposite to an 
Eskimo encampment and close to a good stream of water. 
Anchoring at the lower place, we were visited in the evening by 
a number of natives from the encampment. Several books, 
given for distribution by the rev. Mr. Peck, were handed out 
to them, and they immediately held on deck a service of song 
and prayer. These natives had never seen a missionary, but 
had learned to read from others at Fort Chimo who had come in 
contact with the missionaries on the east coast of Hudson bay. 
A pilot, well acquainted with the southern coast of the strait 
as far as Cape Wolstenholme, agreed to accompany us to Fuller-

We started early in the morning of the 8th, and passed 
through King George sound, reaching Douglas harbour at eight

one of which contained a bear lately killed. A number of walrus 
were seen about the small islands a few miles east of Douglas 
harbour. Continuing close to the coast, shallow water was 
encountered while passing inside of Joy island, a few miles east 
of Cape Weggs, where suspiciously low islands fringe the shore. 
After considerable difficulty had been experienced in extricating 
the ship from this dangerous position, deeper water was 
followed to the cape, when the course was laid for Charles 
island. While steaming along the island next morning a ship 
was seen passing out of the strait, but too far away to signal. 
She afterwards proved to be the Strom, belonging to the French 
fur compar y. 
The walrus, so plentiful last year about the western end of 
the island, were now absent; consequently we were unable to 
obtain a supply of dog-food for Fullerton. The course was next 
directed southward for Deception bay, in the mainland, opposite 
the western end of Charles island. When within a few miles of 
its mouth the water became shallow and the bottom uneven, 8
