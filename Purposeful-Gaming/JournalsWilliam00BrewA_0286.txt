  There was a dense fog hanging over the Lake
when I started out at 8 a.m. but it soon cleared
rolling up from the West like a great curtain. We
crossed to Glaspy Cove and skirted the shore to
B. Brook Cove where we made out a bird
swimming in the Lake and paddling out shot
him. It proved to be the Red-throated Loon that
I shot down yesterday, its wing being wounded.

  We landed on the point just as the fog was lifting
Jim was searching the Lake with the glass when
a Sharp-shinned Hawk started out over the water
directly over his head. I had a good shot at 
it and fired both barrels but apparently without
touching it. At the first shot it mounted
straight up, turned, and flew back into the
woods.

  We then returned to camp and rowed up to Pine Pt.
where we landed and eat lunch. After lunch we
went up the North Bay. There were two Old Squaws out in the
middle and we paddled our brushed boat within 20 yds
of them. I shot at one on the water and at the other
as it rose but unaccountably failed to hit either of
them. They flew a long distance & when we 
followed them rose far out of range and 
disappeared down the Lake.

  We next tried to paddle to five grey Loons which
were cruising about in deep water swimming in 
a cluster like Ducks but they scattered and dove before
