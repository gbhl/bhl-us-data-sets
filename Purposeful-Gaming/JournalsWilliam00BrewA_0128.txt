During the pursuit the â™€ (presumably) uttered a cry which 
we have not heard before. We heard several of the
other notes also but the birds, on the whole, were 
much less noisy to-day than heretofore.
  Faxon left at 6 o'clock when I walked over to the 
Central tracks and eastward along the embankment.
Nothing of interest in these meadows so I returned
to the Pout Pond swamp. Saw a fine drake Wood Duck
rise from the pond at sunset and fly off to the
Buch Island swamp where he pitched down among 
the maples.
  A Marsh Hen (palustris) near me seemed to be the
only Cristothorus in this swamp but he was making 
enough noise for a dozen birds singing incessantly and
every now & then mounting and singing on wing.
While listening to him I suddenly heard a song new
to me, a low but exceedingly musical [?], wit-wit-wit-wit
wit, the first note prolonged and higher than the others
which were all in the same key. This song was repeated
three of four times at short intervals. It resembled somewhat
one of the bars of the song of Bachman's Finch. The bird 
was among the cat-tails very near the Marsh Hen.
I suspected the latter of being the author of this
strange song and also thought of Lincoln's Finch
about the only small bird found in Eastern N. A. which
I have not heard sing.
  Bull-frogs in full chorus to-night for the first
time; also green frogs, and toads uttering the summer 
cry. No Hylas Mosquitos annoyed us somewhat for 
the first time this season.
  Took the 7.01 train for Cambridge.
