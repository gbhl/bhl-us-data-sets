APPENDIX Iv. 325 
Favosites gothlandica, Lamarck. 
There are three examples of this coral, of which two show spini- 
form septa in the corallites. The smaller of the two specimens, in 
which septa are seen, is preserved with a small corallum of Acer- 
vularia austini in the same piece of limestone. 
The horizon indicated by the first and last of the above three 
species of corals from Beechey island would be about that of the 
Niagara formation. 
SOUTHAMPTON ISLAND, HUDSON BAY. 
Streptelasma robustum, whiteaves. 
This large and well marked species, described originally from the 
Galena-Trenton of the Lake Winnipeg region, is represented by a 
number of more or less fragmentary specimens. The inner structure 
is well shown in transverse and longitudinal sections. 
favosites gothlandica, Lamarck. 
Over forty specimens from this locality are referable to this well 
known species. In many of them are seen the spiniform septa, char- 
acteristic of all Silurian favosites, and distinguishing them from 
all Devonian forms which apparently without exception possess lin- 
guiform septa. It is possible that more than one species may be here 
represented. The range in size of the corallites in F. gothlandica has 
been noticed by the writer in his * Revision of the genera and species 
of Canadian Palaeozoic corals*,' 1899-1900, but in the present col- 
lection the fragmentary condition of most of the specimens does not 
admit of characters dependent on the outward form of the corallum 
being used with any degree of certainty. 
Syringopora verticillata, Goldfuss. 
A single specimen of this species was obtained at Southampton 
island. Its corallites average about 4 mm. in diameter and are rather 
lax and irregular in their growth, the result of which is that the con- 
necting tubes are poorly developed and comparatively distant. This 
particular mode of growth is admirably shown in specimens, in the 
possession of the Survey, from the north end of Lake Timiskaming. 
* In this report the reader will find extended references to the structure 
of the majority of the species mentioned in these notes.
