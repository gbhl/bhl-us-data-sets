ANNUAL CEREMONY OF THE PAWNEE MEDICINE MEN 5 
able or willing to confer power, and there are some 
indications that all those recognized as guardians were 
related to one or another of the four supernatural 
beings in the west, the messengers of the Evening Star. 
It was believed that every man passed at birth under 
the influence of some supernatural being. No one 
knew who this guardian was, but he would manifest 
himself later in the man's career. He was usually 
discovered when the man fell sick during childhood. 
Medicine men were sent for, and the guardian of the 
one who was to be able to make the cure was thereby 
shown to be the guardian of the child. If, on reaching 
manhood, the boy desired to become a medicine man,

by far the most important. The ability to perform 
feats of magic was simply a tangible evidence that the 
medicine man possessed the knowledge which would 
enable him to cure the sick. The third sort of power 
resembled hypnotism in some of its manifestations. 
By it the medicine man was enabled to subjugate the 
will of another to his own and to render his patient 
passive during ceremonies so that his power could go 
to the soul of the patient and remove the evil influence 
which was at the root of the disease. The pikawiu 
power was also likened to an arrow or bullet in its abili- 
ty to cut off life. Medicine men could throw this power 
into an enemy as one would shoot an arrow, and the 
individual attacked in this way was helpless until 
some other medicine man, who understood the power, 
exercised his magic to draw it out. Among the Pawnee 
there was a class of men and women, not true medicine 
men, who possessed this power and used it for evil
