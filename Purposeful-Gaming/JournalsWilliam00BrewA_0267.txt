him.
  Returning to the river I was about to join the men when
Don struck a Partridge scent and began to "road" it.
I followed him and finally flushed the bird among
young spruces getting a difficult snap shot but bringing
down my bird with a broken wing. He proved to be
an old "drummer" of large size.

  On the way down river we did not fire a shot.
Landed at the Leonard's Pond carry and sent the
men around with the boats. Flushed two Snipe of
which M. killed one. Then crossed the river and beat
the marsh opposite the pond. Don found and pointed
a Snipe which I shot. He also made a beautiful
point on a wounded Black Duck which he caught
in a bed of tall grass.

  It was now getting dark so we took stations and
waited for Ducks. None came near us but I killed
another Snipe which came past me when it was so
dark that I could see him only over the water.
  We saw no less than four Pileated Woodpeckers and
at least six Canada Jays besides a number of smaller
birds. I distinctly heard a Pine Linnet the only one
thus far noted. Hermit Thrushes were abundant
everywhere and we saw a flock of about thirty
Robins. Red-bellied Nuthatches are scarce this year
but I saw several. Have found no Crossbills as yet.
Heard at least three Picoides arcticus in the heavy
spruce forest on the shores of Bottle Brook pond
near Pulpit Rock heard a cry which was quite
new to me. It was apparently made by some
bird in the woods on the mountain side.
