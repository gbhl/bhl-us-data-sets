1890
Oct. 10
Lake Umbagog, Maine.  
  Cloudy and warm with no wind. Light showers in P.M. and
heavy rain after nightfall. A dense fog in the morning lasting
until after nine o'clock.
Started off in the fog at 8 a.m. dragging the boats over                               
Moll's Curry and (starting) taking the Megalloway River.                              
We had rowed about a mile when Jim saw a Sheldrake
coming from behind us & I shot it just as it passed.                           
We landed first at the pond on the left bank just                                          
above Pine Hill pond & found two Wood Ducks there                          
but they flew before we got ready to stalk them &
went into the pond just above Pulpit Rock. We went
in after them but they were in the grass and rose out
of range going past M. at about 60 yds.
As we were passing Bear Brook we saw a large Fox                               
picking his way along the edge of the meadow just                                    
inside the road. M. tried to get a shot at him but
he disappeared in the bushes before he got near. He
voided his excrement as I was watching him through
my glass, sitting down precisely like a dog.
On reaching Bottle Brook pond M. and I crept in                                        
to the right-hand "leg". There were two Black Ducks                                 
there and as I was stalking them a third
joined them. I got within about 35 yds. of them
and as two came together called to them to put up
their heads which they at once did when I fired
killing one and bringing down another with
a broken wing at very long range with my
second bullet. While I was thus engaged the men
saw several flocks in other parts of the pond but
we got no more shots. The wounded duck swam across
the pond and hid under a log where Don found
