1867
Thursday, January 10,.
 A.M. cloudy. P.M. clear. Got a
ride from our house to the Colledges
on the way to report and from
the gymnasium home comeing
from school. Went shooting
in P.M. into Watertown and
both of us fired into a flock
of about fifty snow buntings
flying and killed a very
handsome one. We "drew
lots" for him but as I got
him I gave him to Ruth.
 Also saw five or six redpolls.
 Got home at 5.45 P.M. Saw
a blue jay. Went up to
the Russell's in the evening
about my Caesar which was
very hard. Father & Mother
called on Mr [?]
Friday, January 11, 1867
 Cloudy all day but occasionally
the sun would shine out for a
few minutes. Rode part of the 
way home on a pung. In P.M.
went shooting and I had only
gone as far as Charles River
when I saw four snow buntings
feeding on the ground. Broke
the leg of one but did not get him
then followed them up and shot
two and could easily have shot
another. Came home with my
gun and went up to my
squirrel trap with C. Easter and put
it in a new place. Saw some
meadow larks on the other side
of the river. Studied at home all
the evening on my Caesar and father
cleaned my gun. Thur. at 8 A.M. 12 [degrees]
at 9.30 P.M. 22 [degrees]
