of the neighboring sand hills. Robins also occurred at frequent
intervals on the marshes where they were running about
like Plover on the mud flats and borders of salt ponds.
  [margin] Terns and Sheldrake [/margin] 
We took a cart path which wound around the inner
edge of the sand dunes until we were stopped by an
inlet [delete]from the Bay[/delete] where a broad creek which drains
the marshes empties into Buzzard's Bay. There were
several Terns flying about this inlet so I left the horse
and buggy behind and crept forward under cover of
the sand hills until I reached the crest of a ridge
directly over the water. Here a most interesting scene awaited
me. On the opposite side of the inlet within long gunshot
lay five Sheldrake asleep on the sand six or eight feet 
from the water. Terns were flying up and down the 
channel, fishing, while others were congregated on a sand
spit that made out [?] [?] some two hundred
yards beyond the inlet. There were at least 35 or 40
in all of these interesting and beautiful birds of which
number considerably more than half were Roseate Terns. 
From my elevated position I had a rare chance to watch 
the fishing birds pass and repass and plunge into the
water for their prey and I lay among the beach grass
for more than an hour observing them and takings notes. 
They saw me, of course, but after a little while became
so accustomed to my presence as to show no fear 
or suspicion. The Sheldrake did not [?] [?] for a 
long time until, at length, two of them which had
taken to the water and worked up the creek, caught
sight of my hat and flew the three on the sound shortly
following them. 
  We returned to town at 2 PM.
