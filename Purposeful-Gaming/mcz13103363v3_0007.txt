Wednesday, January 2.
Alternately cloudy and
clear. The snow melted but
little. In P.M. finished
the redpoll stuffed yesterday
and skinned the remaining 
one. In the evening went
up to the Russells to study
my Caesar and got home

finished the redpoll skinned
in the P.M. Went to bed 
at 10.30. The heifer came
in from the country today.
Two men tried Harry and gave 
father    in echange. The
weather today was not cold
but as there was little sun the
snow did not melt. Made some [?]
