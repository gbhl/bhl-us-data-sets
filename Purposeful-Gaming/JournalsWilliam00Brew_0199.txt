1888
Dec. 15
Great Island, Hyannis, Massachusetts
Clear and warmer but still sharp & frosty. Ther. 20[degrees] at 8 A. M.
Strong N. W. wind through forenoon. Dead calm in P. M. Sun
warm and pleasant.
  After breakfast went first to the place where we saw
the Kildeer yesterday. Found three there this morning
feeding along the base of a steep ridge. I made a long
circuit and came upon them from behind. The moment
I showed my head over the ridge they started with shrill
cries of alarm (killdee - killdee killdee, Kill-deee killdeee).
Although they rose within fifteen yards they doubled &
twisted so that I succeeded in firing only one barrel but
that was effectual the bird dropping stone dead on the
sward at the base of the hill where it lay with its
beautiful tail spread out like a fan.
  We next drove to the deer forest through which we walked
starting about fifteen deer among them three fine bucks.
Seven started in one herd in the great opening
presenting a most beautiful sight as they bounded off.
In some dense pine (P. rigida) woods at the east end
of the park we came upon a mixed flock of small
birds, about ten Chickadees, several Kinglets & Nuthatches
(S. canadensis) and two Chrysomitris tristis. The latter I 
killed at one shot. Hearing the Nuthatches whining in
peculiar low excited tones and incessantly, I went in search
of them and found them dancing about among the
branches of a bushy pine. I suspected an Owl and looking
closely soon discovered one sitting erect and still on
a horozontal branch. It looked gray and ragged like a
weather-beaten piece of bark. I took it for a gray Scops
but on shooting it found I had a Nyctale acadica.
I gave the specimen to Cory. (over),
