feelers. The head was covered with a black-dyed 
buffalo robe and painted and decorated with downy 
feathers. The image of the turtle, in the center of 
which was the fire place, and that of the witch woman, 
were made the next day. The woman's image con- 
sisted of a willow frame covered with grass and sur- 
faced with clay. The features were modeled, and the 
eyes were made with pumpkin seeds blackened in the 
center. A buffalo scalp was placed on the head, and 
to this were attached long braids of human hair which 
hung down to the knees. The figure was dressed in a 
buffalo robe. 
When the images had been made, a ceremony was 
held by which each of the medicine men received power 
from either the monster or the witch woman. Some 
chose one, and some the other. On the day following, 
they went to cut the cedar tree which was to be placed 
just inside the entrance. When they found a suitable 
tree, they formed a circle around it, prayed to it, made 
presents to it of robes and other things, and finally 
took power from it. When this had been done, they cut 
it down. As it fell, they began to hypnotize each other 
and work sleight of hand. They then picked it up and 
carried it back to the village singing. As they neared 
the village, a second party of medicine men came out to 
meet them, and began to hypnotize them and try to 
drive them back. The party with the tree were more 
powerful, and gradually drove the others back to the 
edge of the village. There the tree was laid down, and 
all the people came and threw offerings on it. These 
offerings were gathered up, and were finally given to 
the medicine men. The tree was then taken to the lodge 
and set up, and its branches were covered with white 
downy feathers. That night they made the images of 
the Morning Star and the heavenly gods. These were 
flat pieces of hide, cut in the outline of a man. The 
image of the Morning Star was fastened to a long pole
