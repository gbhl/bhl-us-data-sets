many Marsh Wrens (all palustris). Two Bitterns began pumping
about 200 yds. apart. As we rowed slowly down stream
these voices became harder, less gulping & watery. In short
a change of position changed them from "pumpers" to
"stake-drivers." Faxon was convinced of this. Torrey also admitted
it finally.
  In tall canary grass standing in water a foot or more deep we
heard on the right side of the river & about 20 yds. in from
its margin the same bird that I noted during my last
visit, June 1887. Cluck-cluck-cluck-cluck it called every
few seconds, the tone of the sound very like that of a clucking 
hen, the notes all on one key and without special accent.
Faxon heard this mystery in this same marsh last year. There
seems to be only one each year. We could think of nothing
but a Galhinch!
  Rowed & paddled slowly down to a little below the three arched
stone bridge. A Yellow-billed Cuckoo singing [delete]at intervals[/delete] on a
hillside among pines. Marsh Wrens, at intervals, three or
four near together, usually. A Night Heron & two Green
Herons flying over high. [delete]up[/delete]. Below the stone bridge two
Bitterns, one pumping, the other flying low over the meadow.
Eave Swallows in numbers, one or two White-bellies, and an
occasional Martin. Returning we saw two Wood Duck a
little above the bridge. They passed within 75 yds. flying
slowly, low down. As nearly as I could make out both
were drakes. We lunched at sunset, floating in mid-stream
just opposite the spot where I heard the coo, coo-coo bird
last year. No cooing there to-night. A Carolina Dove
cooing in the pines there to-night. A Carolina Dove
cooing in the pines to the west & a Parula singing there.
Another Dove passing over high, flying very swiftly. A
Bobolink, also, flying so high as to be nearly invisible, dropping
a snatch of his messy song as he passed over us. [delete]fully[/delete] A
