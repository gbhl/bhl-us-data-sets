coast, and it is highly probable that no important deposits will 
be found in the basic rocks of that side of the bay. 
Small quantities of copper-pyrites were observed in the dia- 
base schists of the south side of Hudson strait, but never in 
sufficient amounts to constitute mines of that mineral. 
I was informed by Captain Adams, of the Whaler Diana, that 
he had picked up specimens of copper ore lying loose on the 
surface a few miles in rear of Clyde river on the east coast of 
baffin island. 
Among the specimens brought home by Hall from Frobisher 
and Cyrus Field bays, in the southeast part of baffin island, 
were bornite and pyrite, showing that copper ores also occur in 
that portion of the island. 
iron.-mention has been made of the iron ores on the west 
shores of Ungava bay, on the north side of Payne river. The 
rocks in which these ores are found have been altered by the 
intrusion of granites. They now consist of quartzites, mica- 
hornblende schist and crystalline limestone, and are the metam- 
orphic representatives of the unaltered iron-bearing rocks of 
the interior of Labrador peninsula and the east coast of Hud- 
son bay. In localities where the rocks are unaltered the iron 
ores occur either as carbonates in a cherty rock, or as a mixture 
of magnetite and hematite intimately associated with chert 
and jasper. At Payne river the iron-bearing beds have a thick- 
ness of 420 feet. The upper 70 feet is a light-yellow, fine 
granular quartzite containing patches of ankerite and lime. 
Towards the top the rock shades to a dark bluish-gray, from 
the presence of large quantities of magnetite in small flattened 
grains, together with small scales of specular iron. These are 
usually mixed with quartz with evidence of foliation, and at 
other places are in large masses of nearly pure ore. Underlying 
these beds is 350 feet of dark-bluish slaty quartzite holding con- 
siderable magnetite and hematite, and shading upwards into a
