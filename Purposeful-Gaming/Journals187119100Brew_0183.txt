birds sounds were there churning of Bobolinks (now
in small numbers compound with a week ago) then
chattering of the Blackbirds, and the occasional
low twittering of the Swallows. Not a single bird
was heard singing, except a Goldfinch, during
our passage through the meadow. In the 
woods, through the middle of the day, an occasional
Red-eye song rather listlessly and a REd start
Pine Warbler, and Creeper (Mniotilta) were heard
once or twice each in the great mixed flock.
Practically the singing of the birds may be said 
to be now quite over for this season.
  The rose mallow, eupatorium, and iron weed are
the most conspicuous flowers along the river now.
The cardinal flower is also to be seen in places
glowing among the green corners or button bushes
on the banks but it is not common or found
in many places. The button bush is quite out 
of bloom.
  Where the meadows have been mown the grass
has already sprung up to a height of six or
eight inches and is of the same thunder green as
in spring. The uncut tracts are various shades 
of brown, usually a sick russet-brown.
