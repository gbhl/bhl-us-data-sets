it for fuel on his ships. The Franklin search parties later 
found outcrops of coal in other places along the southern and 
eastern shores of that island and in the cliffs of Bathurst island. 
These outcrops of coal indicate that the seams seen in the 
southern cliffs will be found extending inland over the greater 
portion of the islands, where they are covered by several 
hundred feet of newer rocks. no coal has been found in the 
Carboniferous rocks of Ellesmere island. 
The mineral occurs in thin beds along with sandstones and 
shales, and is a good quality of bituminous coal. 
In the folded Tertiary rocks found in the vicinity of Lady 
Franklin sound on the West side of Kennedy channel several 
outcrops of excellent bituminous coal have been discovered. The 
beds in the neighbourhood of Fort Conger have been mined 
along the outcrop and used for fuel by the Nares expedition and 
by Greely and Peary.
