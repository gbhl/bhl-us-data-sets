Ashby, Massachusetts
filled with raspberry bushes or beds of luxuriant ferns
(Dicksonia). In places the spruces are scattered about
singly or in groups over the smooth turf of the
mountain side. These spruce pastures are identical
in every why with those of northern New England.
Other characteristic birds here were
Sparrows and Field Sparrows in the openings Black
and Yellow-Warblers, Myrtle Warblers, Cedar Birds,
Towhees, Robins, Chippewees, Sparrows, and Snow
Birds among the spruces.
  We started for Ashby about six o'clock
and had as usual a delightful drive home, hear-
ing and seeing many birds, but none of any par-
ticular interest.
