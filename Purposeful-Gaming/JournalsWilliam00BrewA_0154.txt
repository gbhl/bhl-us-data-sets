Wayland and Sudbury, Mass.
[Trip to Wayside Inn]
interesting birds. Two [male] Blackburnian Warblers singing in the tops of
the taller pines, where they doubtless have nests, two Solitary Vireos, 
a Hummingbird in the shorter pines on the hillside buzzing
about & squeaking but unsure. Found nest of our pair of Solitary 
Vireos, suspended at end of hemlock spray 5 ft. above the ground and
containing four young about half grown & feathered. Also found a 
beautiful nest of the Oven bird with 4 eggs (incubated) and a nest of 
Vireo olivaceus with 4 eggs far advanced.  Did not molest any of 
these nests.  Mosquitos very numerous and troublesome in this
swamp. Birds singing were: Vireo solitarius, V. olivaceus. D. blackburnian, 
D. virens, D. pinus, Seiurus aurocapillus, Contopus virens, Emp. minimus
(in the heart of the dry pine woods, a most unusual place) and
Harporhymhus rufus.

  Drove back to Wayland early in the afternoon, stopping
often to listen for certain birds. Passed within [23?] yds. of three  
Carolina Doves which were feeding in a field of newly sown oats
by the roadside.  When we stopped a little beyond them they [at?]
over flew. Saw two turtles (E. picta) laying or about to lay their 
eggs in some fresh gravel which had been spread this morning on a road
bordering the river. Examined one and found it firmly planted
over a hole about 4 inches deep and an inch in diameter no eggs in hole. Earth in hole
wet. Turtle did not try to escape & when replaced resumed its rigid
position. We did not  not examine the other.
