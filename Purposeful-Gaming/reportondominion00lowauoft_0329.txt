' The fauna in Dc is merely a repetition, and in the case of 
certain species, a further development, of the forms found in 
Db. It will thus be seen that there is a spring in regard to the 
fauna between the upper layers in Series B and the lower ones 
in Series D, which more particularly resemble Lower or Middle 
Devonian. The concordantly embedded ( ?) Series C might, 
therefore, be thought to represent uppermost Silurian as Well as 
lowest Devonian.' 
( Divisions Dd and Df are poor in fossils, and are partly shale 
divisions. In the impure limestone of Dg occur again numerous 
fossils, among which are Atrypa reticularis, Rhynchonella cfr. 
cuboides, Spirifer cfr. undifera, productus sp., Terebratula cfr. 
Dielasma, Pterinea sp., Avicula sp., modiolopsis sp., Pleuroto- 
maria sp., Proetus sp. Traces of placoderm fish are also met 
with. Above these strata are beds of purer limestone Dh, and 
above these again some less pure, Di. The uppermost strata of 
Di alternate with strata of light-gray quartz-sandstone terminat- 
ing in a clay-sandstone, which in places is richly fossiliferous, 
though the fossils are in a bad state of preservation. Among 
these are lamellibranchiata, Dechenella sp., remains of Holo- 
ptychius, &c.' 
' This argillaceous sandstone is simultaneously the last link 
in Series D and the first in Series E. This is a huge collection 
of quartz-sandstone strata building up the mountains on both 
sides of the inner part of gaasefjord. The lowest part, which 
is 900 to 1,200 feet in thickness, consists almost exclusively of 
quartz-sandstone. On the north side of Skrabdalen, in the 
sandstone profile, occur conglomerate strata, half an inch to an 
inch in thickness. In these were found considerable remains
