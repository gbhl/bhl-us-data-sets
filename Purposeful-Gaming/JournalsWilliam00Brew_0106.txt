then tracks had miniature duplications evidently
made by a very young animal of the same kind.
Probably a female Caribou and her calf had
passed along the beach the previous night.
  Leaving Crocker I crossed to a rocky point 
and lunched there. After this I put up my 
sail and beat down the lake tacking each
time nearly from shore to share. The
entire afternoon was passed pleasantly in
this way for the breeze was strong &[and]
steady and it was such a perfect day
that I never for a moment tired of the
superb sweep of mountain's forest clad shores,
and blue waters that surround me.
  I saw very few Ducks & no small birds.                 
Off Moll's Rock well out in the water I suddenly                    
discovered four Ducks swimming about two hundred
yards ahead.  I had barely time to get my gun
ready (for I was sailing very fast) when I
was within long range.  Up to this trim they
did not seem to notice me but just as I felt sure
of getting a good shot they stretched up their  necks
& flew, rising very like Black Ducks. I fired one
barrel & dropped one at fully 60 yds. It proved to
be a [female] Pintail & the other turn was certainly the
same. This was the only shot I fired all day.

  In Black Island Cove I sailed down on a                         
swarm of young Sheldrake not larger than Pigeons.              
I took them at first for Teal. They swam in a
close cluster & finally "raced" off along the surface
saw several Ospreys, Eagles, & Great Blue Herons.
The steamer picked me up at sunset off Heyward's
