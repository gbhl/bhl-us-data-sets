1889
July 1
Ashby to Fitchburg, Mass.
  Clear and very hot. Starting at eleven o'clock we
drove to Fitchburg where Faxon took the train for Mt.
Greylock, while I returned to Boston. On this drive we
noted nothing of any particular interest except
two Black Throated Blue Warblers which we heard
singing by the roadside about three miles above
Fitchburg. They were in deep, damp woods along
a ravine where the undergrowth was almost
exclusively of mountain laurel which grew in
tangled thickets.
