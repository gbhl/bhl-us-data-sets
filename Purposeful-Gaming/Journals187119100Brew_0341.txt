(Aug.15) 
others spreading out more like Bobolinks but, alway
flying in a nearly direct course, and were inclining from
side to side in the usual way. Finally the whole throng
dashed into and through a cluster of young white maples
and black willows - trees 12 to 15 ft. high - on the end of the
point around which the river bends. Dosius swished through
the leaves but not one, as far as I could see, actually settled.
About 100 Red-wings had previously gone to roost in this thicket
and the sudden dash of the Swallows threw them into a panic.
For a moment the air was black with bird and their wings
made a rushing like wind in the tree tops. The Red-wings soon
settled again and after a few high evolutions the Swallows
made another headlong dash at the thicket. This time
perhaps one quarter of them alighted and the remainder soon
joined them. For several minutes more they kept up a continual
fluttering among the leaves. I could easily see them against the
light in the west and noticed that they perched on the
maple leaves bending them down with their weight. A small
number settled in the willows. They made a curious chattering
for a while very like English Sparrow. It was nearly dark
before they were all settled and still and dusky before
they alighted at all. After all was quiet I pushed my
boat noisily in among the trees and thrashed the branches
with the paddle, shouting at the same time but although
most of the Red-wings decamped in great alarm only three or four
swallows could be dislodged.
  Paddled home in the darkness. River very black & still
with no fog. Muskrats plumping in occasionally & fish
splashing under the bow. In a dark reach an [?]
light-colored bird started from a tree on the shore &
flew off in silence. It may have been a Heron but I took
it for an Owl. Warblers lisping overhead after 8 P.M.
