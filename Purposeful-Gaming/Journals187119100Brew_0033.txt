against the dark solid green of the pines.
  In all my experience in Massachusetts I 
do not remember anything to compare with
this sight. I doubt if such a wealth of
beauty is ever equalled elsewhere, even in 
the tropics.
  Birds were numerous, but as on yesterday
I saw nothing but the regular Summer birds
of this locality. Where can the migrants be?
There were Brown Thrashers in great abundance
making the air ring with their powerful voices
Field Sparrows in all the open pastures. Chestnut
sided Warblers in the swamps. Nashville Warblers
and Towhees among the birches, and in the oak 
woodlands Tanagers and Grosbeaks both in full
song. In my opinion we have no song bird in 
Massachusetts that can equal the Rose Breasted
Grosbeak.
  I saw two Hairy Woodpeckers and found two
Blue Jays nests, one with 4, the other with 5 eggs.
  In our lilac bushes a White-throated Sparrow
was spending the afternoon.
