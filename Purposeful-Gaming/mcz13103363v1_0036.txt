I observed another one
on the 11th it would
walk along the edge
of the water like a
sandpiper but if it
came to any small
inlet it would prefer
wading through
it to going around

jerked its tail upwards
as it walked and

in some bushes and I

commenced making harsh
grating sounds following

softer sounds and flying
off in the direction of
Charles River wher they
doubtless fed during the
night.
