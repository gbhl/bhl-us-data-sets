1886
July 13
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and cool; a fine invigorating day.
  Spent the forenooon in the Estabrook
country with Deane returning to dinner.
  A few birds were singing freely even at 
noon the most prominent being Red-eyed vireos,
Cat birds, Chewinks, Song Sparrows and Field
Sparrows. Heard no Warblers except a single
D. Vireos. The long of the Field Sparrows run
to me especially rivet and plain at this 
reason purpose because of its "margin of silence"
Tanagers were singing rather generally especially
at noon.
  Saw very few birds and only two or three
broods of young, among them are of D. Pennsylvanica.
