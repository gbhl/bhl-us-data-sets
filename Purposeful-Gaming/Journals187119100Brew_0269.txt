away, but a pair came within long
gunshot of us on their way up river and
S. fired at them.
  The Great Blue Heron was struggling
northward against the strong wind &
passed low down over some pine woods
near us.
  We saw only two White-bellied Swallows,
both together, flying over the water.
  The maples are thick with blossoms, the
poplars with catkins. In a few springy
places the grass is beginning to show a
little green but the fields are still
cere [sere] and brown. In the woods, the
snow is a foot or more deep in spots
and there is little bare ground there.
Yet on the edge of a sandy field we
found a number of cicendellas which
were as alert and active as in summer.
Besides them I saw a honey bee, numbers
of spiders, a few wingless grasshoppers,
and a small brown butterfly about as
large as [diagram].
