1867
Tuesday, November 12.
  Cloudy all day but did
not rain much. Ther. about
50 [degrees]���60 [degrees]���40 [degrees].
Rose at 5 A.M. & went
shooting. Went up round
the Glacialis & back by 'the
pond'. Wounded a red
squirrel badly & fired at a
robin flying. Heard a rushing
sound pass by me before light
probably made by a flock of
ducks. Heard several snow
buntings. Got back from school,
had some lunch, & began the
blk duck shot Saturday & worked
on him till 10 P.M. studying
some time in the evening.
R. Deane called in, in P.M.

Wednesday, November 13.
  Cloudy all day but cleared
off towards evening. Ther. about
30 [degrees]���32 [degrees]���26 [degrees].
When I awoke the ground
was covered with about an
inch of snow which on the
grass remained all day.
Walked down to school with
R's. When I go home from
school found Dick here.
He stayed till 3 P.M.
I then went shooting but did
not fire at anything. Saw
2 snow birds & numbers of tree
sparrows & just at dark I started
two snipe from the  brook in the lane
which flew over me uttering their
shrill squeaks & lit somewhere near
the Musk rat pond. Went up to
R's in evening & copied into my log book.
