GEOLOGY 203 
The Huronian rocks of Labrador are marked by the number 
of repetitions of the strata caused by thrust faults in all the 
areas examined, and this repetition of measures by similar 
faults may account for the number of bands of limestone found 
in the southern part of Baffin island. 
The crystalline rocks appear to form the southwest coast of 
baffin island for some distance beyond King cape on the east 
side of Fox channel, when they give place to a wide area of low 
lands extending nearly to the head of Fox channel, where the 
crystalline rocks again form the higher lands to the north and 
east of Fury and Hecla strait. 
On the late voyage of the Neptune the rocks of the east side 
of baffin island were examined at Ponds inlet, on the islands 
on both sides of Cumberland gulf, and at Cape Haven and 
Frenchmans cove on Cyrus Field bay. In other places the ship 
passed sufficiently near the shores to allow of a good idea being 
formed of the rocks by the aid of powerful glasses. 
Examinations of the rocks were made at Button point, the 
southeast part of Bylot island, on the north side of the entrance 
to Ponds inlet; also in the vicinity of Salmon river some thirty 
miles up the inlet and on its south side, and at Erik harbour on 
the same side near the mouth of the inlet. At all these places 
typical Laurentian gneisses and schists were obtained. Among 
the specimens brought home from these localities is a light- 
coloured coarse-grained augen-gneiss consisting largely of white 
and pink feldspar, with thin bands of biotite and little quartz. 
Another seeming variety of this rock is a well-banded fine- 
grained mica-gneiss composed of pink and white bands of felds- 
par separated by thin bands of mica. Associated with these 
are bands of very quartzose gneiss varying in colour from light 
to dark from the varying proportions of mica present. These 
gneisses are usually found containing a considerable number of 
dark-red garnets; and they probably represent a metamorphic
