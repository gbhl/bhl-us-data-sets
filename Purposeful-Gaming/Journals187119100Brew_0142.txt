1886
July 25
Drive from Groton to Concord, Mass.
  Cloudy and Sultry with little wind up to noon.
  Left Groton at 9 A.M and reached
Concord about noon. The distance is said to
be eighteen miles. The road is moist around
and existing with scarcely a shaded
stretch the curtain distance although then
are occasional patterns of woods a little back 
of the bordering fence. The country is largely
sandy and sterile with bound out fields.
  Birds sing fairly well for their first 
two hours. We heard birds the common
species four Hermit-Thrushes all signing at
the same time within an area of a few
acres and writing hearing of one another.
Here was in LIttleton about 2 miles west of the 
village in Sandy Pitch pine woods.
  In this same time we also heard from
Yellow-winged Sparrows, two in the same
field. The country affords many found out 
fields  exactly invited to their habits and 
they are doubtless common.
  Grass Finches and my Sparrows were
the most frequent and [?] was 
majors, Field Sparrows less so.
