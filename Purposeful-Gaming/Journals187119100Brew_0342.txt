Migration                
1887
Aug. 6  
Concord, Mass.
Clear and cool evening after a hot day. Wind changed
to N. (from S.W.) at about 5 p.m.
  Heard the first migrants, perhaps a dozen, all
apparently Warblers, between 8 and 10 p.m.
Aug. 7  
Clear and cold for the season. High N. wind all day.
  This evening heard about a dozen Warblers passing.
Aug. 8 
Clear and cool. Wind N.Three or four Warblers
heard after dark.
Aug. 14 
Clear and warm. Wind S.W., very light all day.
  Was on the river from sunset to 9.30 p.m. & in my
room as late as 11 P.M. but did not hear a single bird.
Aug.15 
Weather precisely similar to yesterday. Wind S.W. light all
day.  Evening still & clear. Warblers began lisping
at about 8 P.M. and were even passing almost constantly
up to 11 P.M. when I went to bed. This is the first 
really heavy flight of the season. Curiously although
I heard no birds last evening the Yellow Warblers left
almost to a bird either last night or the night before.
Aug. 23
Cambridge. A heavy N.E. storm with strong wind
and torrents of rain. Wilson's Thrushes migrating
in numbers between 8 and 9 P.M. flying low and calling
evidently attracted and confused by the city lights.
Aug. 24 
Cambridge. Weather precisely like yesterday. [?] [?]
flying in numbers again this evening. No
Warblers heard either night. Evidently the 
Thrushes must have started in foul weather as
this storm is widespread on the whole East.
