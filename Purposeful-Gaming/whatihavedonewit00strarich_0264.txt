WHAT I HAVE DONE WITH BIRDS 
join in, and again the Whole flock unite in a sweet, inquiring, 
throaty vocalizing that is music in Which I delight. The Brown 
Thrush chants exquisitely from a thorn opposite; the Oriole flings 
golden notes on Wing; and the clear, strong Whistle of the Cardi- 
nal carries beautifully With the water; but the undertones of the 
Jays are a minor melody Which fills in the pauses of these star 
performers With constant harmony.
