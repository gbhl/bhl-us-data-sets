176 CRUISE of THE NEPTUNE 
sembling dominoes, but having a greater number of spots on 
them; the slabs are thrown in the air, and the number of spots 
are counted on the slabs that fall right side up. A circular disc 
of ivory, usually with sawn edges, is threaded on a loop of sinew 
and made to revolve in the same manner as our own small boy 
spins a large button. 
The girls have dolls made of wood, and cleverly clothed to 
represent their elders. The carving of walrus ivory passes 
many an hour of the long winter. As a rule the carvings are

composition, and is composed in a rough metre to suit the air, 
but does not rhyme, and no great attention is paid to the
