1887                                      
Oct. 20 
Grantville, Mass.
Clear and warm with high S.E. wind.  
  With H.W. Henshaw took the 7.45 train to Grantville 
for a days Grouse shooting. Upon reaching one destination
hired a depot carriage in which I rode to the
turnpike swamp leaving H. at his Father's house to
change his clothes etc.
  While waiting for him I beat the swamp. On its
eastern edge. "Don" struck the trail of a Grouse and
roading it out into the middle of the swamp came
to a staunch point. After much urging he finally 
flushed the bird which I shot making a very hard
snap shot through thick alders. It proved a very red
bird, an adult â™€apparently. It fell in a pool of
water and made a great noise in its dying flurry.
H. arrived a moment later and we three beat the old
growth woods finally finding a bird which Don pointed
on the edge of a swamp. H. shot at and missed it.
"Don" found his third Grouse among cedars near a 
house. He pointed it staunchly but I failed to get a
shot. I saw here a Catbird.
  Crossing the road we then beat a long wooded ridge
when H. saw six or seven Grouse yesterday. We found
only two to-day. "Don" flushed the first. The other
we heard drumming in bit of very stiff cover by a
brook. Entering "Don" roaded this bird and finally
pointed it amoung alders. It flushed and I gave
it one and H. three barrels. It was hard hit but got
off and we failed to find it again.
  Late in the afternoon we started two more Grouse. "Don"
pointed the second which I brought down wing-tipped 
by a remarkably quick snap shot through very thick
brush.  The dog ran in on this bird pulling out
