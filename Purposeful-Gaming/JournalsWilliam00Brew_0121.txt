1888
Sept. 17.
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
A.M. cloudy; noon clear and intensely hot.
Late P.M. cloudy with strong S.E. wind. Left
Lakeside at 10 A.M. Jim going on ahead
to pitch camp at Moll's Rock. Lumen first
paddled me up the Cambridge. On Brown's
point I shot three D. palmarum. They were
among scrubby growth and alone. In
Tyerson's pond found about 18 Sheldrake.
Lumen started them while I lay in wait
near the outlet. They passed wide but I
knocked down two, one wounded which
went ashore and hid in the grass
where I found it. Passing B. point I
discovered a mink among the rocks
and watched it for some time with
my glass. Lunched on the sand beach
at B. Point. Thence across and around
Great Island. Two Snipe rose from mud
flats and dropped in grass. Landed
but they rose wild and flew out of
sight. Flushed another and shot it,
a moment later two Black Ducks rose
from grass within 20 yards. I gave one both
barrels (of #12) and it dropped dead 200
yds off. This ended our shooting. Reached
Moll's Rock at 5 P.M. A Bubo hooting
at night behind the tent.
