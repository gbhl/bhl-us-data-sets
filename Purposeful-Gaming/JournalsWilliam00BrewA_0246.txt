1890.
Sept. 29
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
  Cloudless from sunrise to sunset, with little or no wind.
Morning and evening sharp, midday soft & warm. Spent the morning 
about the house. In the afternoon had the old horse harnessed and
started for the Woodcock cover at the foot of Upton Hill opposite 
the Strickland place where H. and I found and left several birds on 
the 25th. Just after passing Brown's I saw an adult White-crowned
Sparrow in the road and a few yards further on two more. They 
flew into the bushes as I passed but after finding a good place to 
leave the horse I returned and killed [delete]them both[/delete] two, both old birds, at
one shot. There were two more, one an immature bird, bit I could
not get a shot at either of them.
  I left the horse at Strickland's and descending the hill to the
spruces beat them pretty thoroughly. Don found and pointed a Wood-
cock soon after we entered the place. It rose behind me giving me
an awkward shot which I missed. This was the only bird I saw but 
the dog started another in a place so thick that I could only hear
its wings.
  Got back to Lakeside a little after sunset and walked down to
the patch of weeds near the landing. Here I started and shot a
young White-crowned Sparrow.
