March 4
Enterprise, Florida
Clear and warmer but yet cool enough for comfort.
  Starting at 8.30 drove out beyond the
de Barry place and spent about two hours
hunting for Quail. Found none at all. Cory
took only his red dog Tom the other two
having been sent on ahead to Mim's. This red
dog is a tall, rakish-looking fellow with a 
fine nose and handsome action but he is
not a very good Quail dog. 
  During our drive through the pine woods
(we did not once alight from the wagon)
we [saw?] a fair number of small birds including
two or three Bachman's Finches (aestivalis ones)
several Bluebirds, Pine Warblers, Yellow red-polls,
Mockingbirds, Shrikes etc. One Great Blue Heron
in a pond and a fine Buteo borealis circling
over the pines. Started a single Carolina Dove 
and two or three Meadow Larks. The latters, Flickers, 
Pine Warblers, Bluebirds and Mocking Birds in 
full song.
  Took the 1.40 train for Mim's a station
within five miles of Titusville. Dago prairie
was almost if not quite perfectly dry with
fires burning over it. Saw five Turkey Buzzards
there. Also Meadow Larks and one flock
of about thirty Carolina Doves.
