The shore they swam into the grass and
we paddled within 40 yds. They were well
bunched when I fired and my first bar-
rel stopped four. With my second I knock-
ed over a fifth. Only one escaped. Two of the 
wounded flew as we approached and had
to be shot over. There were two Scaup Ducks
with these Widgeon but they both escaped.
Hundreds of Warblers and Sparrows along
the shore. Shot a D. palmarum and Spiz.
monticola and saw a young Zon. leucophrys.
At least 200 Titlarks over the meadows. A
Pigeon Hawk chased one for about 500 yds and
made at least 20 swoops at it but missed
every one the bird finally escaping. The
Hawk then alighted on a stub but flew as we
approached. Returned to camp for dinner. On
the way saw two Grass Birds. To Sweat Meadow in
P. M. About 50 Black Ducks at the usual place. Wa-
ter so high we could not approach them. Near
the head of the brook found a Buffle-head but
he rose wild. I shot both barrels but failed to stop
him. A fine ad. [male] Marsh Hawk beating over the mar
sh. At least 200 Titlarks in this meadow. To Moose
Point at evening. Saw about 30 Black Ducks a pair came
past me. I killed the first and missed the second
Then four came directly over me. Missed with both
barrels, quite unaccountably, for they were near
enough. Heard a Snipe. Water now over river
banks and Moose Point marsh a lake. Flight of
Warblers, Sparrows, and Titlarks to day simply
amazing. Thousands of small birds everywhere.
