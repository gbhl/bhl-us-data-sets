1886
June 1
  Clear and warm. Wind S.E to S.W.
  Starting at about 10 a.m. I spent the fore-
noon on the river, going as far down as Balls' Hill.
  On the way down I actually saw from Wood Duck,
all different birds. Two started together in one place,
the other two, also together, less than half-a-miile
below. Of the first two, one was certainly a drake; the 
others I could not make out.
  A single Black-poll was singing early this 
morning near the Manse, but during the forenoon
I saw nothing that was not settled for the summer.
  At Balls' Hill I was sitting quietly on the ground
at the base of an oak, when a large Woodchuck ap-
peared and rambled about within a few yards of 
me, not seeing me of course. He was busily engaged
most of the time in nibbling of the stems and leaves 
of the sarsaparilla plant. I was surprised at the 
quickness of his movements and the extent of ground
which he covered in a short time.  
  I heard a Carolina Rail calling and fleshed a 
Virginia Rail but searched in vain for the nests of 
both birds.
  The blue-joint along the river is now nearly up
to my shoulders. The yellow water lily is in bloom
and the margin of the channel is covered with pads
and various forms of aquatic vegetation.
