easy and cheap, if advantage were taken of the great water- 
power of the nastapoka river, which falls 160 feet into the sea 
within a few miles of the best ore deposits, and from which 
electrical power might be generated easily and cheaply. Owing 
to the distance of these ores from the nearest furnaces, and the 
want of experience in the navigation of Hudson strait, the ship- 
ment of them is at present out of the question. No coal is found 
in Hudson bay, so that economical smelting near the mines 
cannot be attempted, until electrical smelting becomes practic- 
able some time in the future. 
In all the fields where extensive areas of iron-bearing rocks 
occur in the Lake Superior region, the search by drilling has 
disclosed large deposits of concentrated ore, and there is little 
doubt that such a search in the Hudson bay region would lead 
to similar discoveries, as the manner in which the ores occur is 
favourable for such concentrations. 
mica.-active mining operations for mica are being carried 
on at Lake harbour, on the north side of Hudson strait. This 
mine is being worked in connection with the whaling steamer 
Active. A number of white men are brought to the place from 
Scotland in the early summer, who, with the assistance of the 
Eskimos, work the mine, and then return home in the fall. Last 
summer thirteen tons of excellent mica were taken out in this 
manner. Other deposits of this mineral will probably be found 
on that coast to the westward in association with the crystalline 
limestones so largely developed there. A mica mine was opened 
some years ago on the west side of Cumberland gulf, but for 
some reason was shortly after abandoned. 
graphite. extensive bands, or veins, of this mineral were 
discovered by Mr. Caldwell to the south of Port Burwell along 
the east shore of Ungava bay. Graphite has also been found in 
the neighbourhood of Cape Wolstenholme, and along the east
