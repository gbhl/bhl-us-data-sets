74: CRUISE OF THE NEPTUNE 
covered. If Frobisher had been on a voyage of discovery he 
might easily have entered Hudson bay, but the search for gold 
being the object he turned back, and entered Frobisher bay by 
passing through the strait to the east of Resolution island. On 
the 1st of August most of the fleet was assembled at the 
Countess of Warwick island, where the ore was mined, and all 
the ships loaded by the end of the month. The ore finally prov- 
ing worthless, nothing further was done to continue the 
discoveries of Frobisher. 
Ten years after the last voyage merchants of London deter- 
mined to fit out another expedition to search for the northwest 
passage. The enterprise was entrusted to John Davis, ' a man 
well-grounded in the art of navigation.' Two vessels, the 
Sunshine and the Moonshine, were employed for the first voy- 
age, with a combined crew of forty-two persons. Davis, on his 
outward voyage, landed on the southern coast of Greenland, and 
named the coast the Land of Desolation. One fiord in latitude 
64 15', where the mission stations of Godhaab and Nye Hern- 
hut are located, he named Gilbert's Sound. Leaving here, 
Davis stood to the westward and northward for five days, and 
on the 6th of August, 1585, discovered land in latitude 66 40', 
quite free from ice. He anchored in the mouth of Exeter sound 
under Mount Raleigh, calling the north foreland Dier's cape 
and the southern one Cape Walsingham. From here he coasted 
southward along the land, and rounded the Cape of Gods Mercy 
into Cumberland gulf, up which he sailed for sixty leagues to 
some islands. On his return he discovered that Cumberland 
gulf was separated from another long inlet, which, not recogniz- 
ing as Frobishers bay, he called Lumlie's inlet. Having crossed 
the mouth of this inlet, Davis then crossed to the south side of 
another great inlet, and renamed its northern point Warwick's 
Foreland, while the south cape was named after John Chidley. 
Davis remarks on the strong tides met with in the entrance to 
Hudson strait.
