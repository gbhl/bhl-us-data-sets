Tiger in P.M. (for the first
time for many years) starting
at about 6 P.M. Rode up
around the 'feeding grounds'
and got home at about
6.45 P.M. Went up to the

Wednesday, April 17, 1867.
  Cloudy all day. Continued
showers through the day,
sometimes raining very hard.
Ther. about 44[degrees] - 48[degrees] - 40[degrees].
The rain has made the grass very
green and the horse chestnut
buds have cracked pen. On the
way to school saw a robin
commencing her nest. When
I got home from school walked
up to Ruth's house with him.
In the P.M. rode Tiger round
the streets for some time & finding
that it had stopped raining,
rode up to Dan's but only stopped
there a few minutes. Got home
at 6.30 P.M. & took a short ride on
Kate. Got out my Latin at home
& went to bed at 10.30 P.M.
