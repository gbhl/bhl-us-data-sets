Oct. 17
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
  The forenoon clear; the afternoon cloudy; the wind south-west
chilly at times, and strong.
  Started down river at eight o'clock in the forenoon. At
Peaslee's brook saw a Duck in the water.  It rose and I killed it.
It proved a Ring-neck. Except Sheldrake, nothing more seen until
reaching the Narrows where I was paddled to a flock of four Horned
Grebes. Shot two sitting, a third as it rose. At the entrance
to Black Island Cove saw fifteen Whistlers near shore. Landed, 
but they flew. Melvin next stalked five Whistlers and four Shel-
drake He got very near them, but two Black Ducks alighted and 
he waited for them, finally getting a fair shot, but missing.
lunched here; thence to the outlet. Four Tringa bonapartii and
an Ereunetes on the mud bar at the mouth. Shot them all. Thence
to Moose Point, seeing nothing. Met two members of the Noyes par-
ty. They had apir[pair] of Spruce Grouse and a Squatorola in their
canoe.

  Returned by way of Glasgow and B Brook coves. In the former
started[startled] six Black Ducks. In the latter fired a long shot at a
Sheldrake and killed a Perisoreus. Melvin waited at the point
outside. Just before I joined him he discovered a flock of about
twenty Old Squaws in the Lake and Luman paddled him out to them. He
shot down four and got three after shooting them all over again.
The flock settled in again near the outlet and Alva paddled me to
within thirty yards of them. I shot two sitting, both old males,
and missed with my second barrel, but got in another shell in time
to catch a third bird as it rose. There were four adult males in
the flock and we shot down all of the, two each. I afterwards shot
a Red-necked Grebe at fully seventy-five yards with No. 8 shot.

  Clear and cool with a rather strong north-west wind, and
rain.
  Our trip to-day was up around Great Island. First saw three
Whistlers in the pond near the Lake House. Sent Alva in to drive
them out and lay concealed near the outlet, I on the south side.
They came directly over me, but rather too high up. I shot both
barrels and hit my first bird hard. We afterwards found him at
the mouth of the river and Melvin shot him as he rose from the
water. Next discovered four Scaup Ducks off the north end of
Great Island, but they proved excessively shy.

  In the gut above the island started [startled] five Sheldrakes. In the
upper part of the Sweat Cove were six Sheldrakes and as many more
Black Ducks. We took stations, sending the guides up to drive
them out.  The Sheldrakes flew over Melvin, three Black Ducks
over me, all rather too high up.  We both failed to bring down any
