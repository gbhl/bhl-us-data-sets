Sept. 9
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Clear and cooler; wind E. to S.E. Mountains nearly free from haze.

  On the Lake all the afternoon, sailing alone up into the
Cambridge R[iver] pond and back, afterwards taking E.R.S. out in a
rowing boat and visiting Sargent's cove. In the latter found three
Ring-neck Plover feeding on a mud flat. They were absurdly
tame allowing us to row within twenty feet or less feeding busily
the while and apparently paying no attention whatever to our
presence.

  There were no waders at the mouth of the Cambridge or in
the pond where I shot the Yellow-legs on the 8th. Heard a
Pileated Woodpecker and this morning saw another crossing 
the Lake flying high and perfectly straight like a Crow.

Sept 10
Cloudy all day with strong E. to S.E. wind.
  Woodcock shooting in the afternoon starting in at Sweat's 
(where I failed to find the bird left on the 5th) following
the alder run to its head, thence through the pastures and
woods to the Brown farm and then back to the house by
way of the road and the birches near the steamboat landing.

near Lakeside[/margin]
  In the isolated coppice surrounded by brakes near the road on
the Brown farm Don started a very large Woodcock. It came
out by me but just as I felt sure of it my right barrel missed
fire and it was too far off when I fired my left. It
alighted on the hillside & Don pointed it but it rose wild
the second time & I did not fire. I started it a third
time near the top of the knoll but had only a snap shot
& missed nor could I find it again. It did not whistle.
  In the cove near the steamboat landing I started
a second Woodcock, a swift flyer and sharp whistler. the
first two rises it merely flirted up & down again & I did not
fire. The third time Don pointed it and it went off like a
bullet over the tree tops until my charge stopped it. Saw an adult Broad-winged Hawk in pasture.
