among alders in the wet run, the wind among
breakers & spruces on a dry Knoll.
  On the drive home saw three Hawks, a Cooper's,
a Sharp-skin & a Broad-wing.  The latter, a            
young bird in golden brown plumage, sat on
a stake by the roadside &[and] when I was within
20 yds. or so flapped up into a Spruce allowing
me to pass without flying again.

  In the afternoon had a glorious sail going                                   
nearly to the Lake House one way and to                       
the head of Sargent's cove the other. Near   
the mouth of the river saw a diving bird
probably a Dabchick, in Sargent's cove a
young Whistler with unfledged wings. The latter             
was very tame at first allowing me to sail
within 30 yds. I shot at & probably missed
him for he dove & doubled on me. After
reappearing he uttered a curious feeble, strident
call as he swam away from me. I chased
him for some time but he had learned
wisdom and eluded me by the most
adroit diving.

  The air this afternoon was singularly soft
and fragrant with a quality that reminded
me of the southern [?]. The woods are
nearly as green & luxuriant as in midsummer.
