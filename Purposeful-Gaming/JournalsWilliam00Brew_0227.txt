1889
Feb. 12
Enterprise, Florida.
Clear and cool. Wind N.
  Spent the entire day hunting Quail
going beyond Orange City on the road 
to Lake Helen. We did not put the
dogs out until we had passed Orange city.
Tried the pointer first then took her up
and put down "Robin" who soon found three
Quail in an old field. We each shot one,
the third escaping.
  After this hunted several miles in vain.
Then took in "Robin" and put down "Nelly".
She striuck the track of a running bevy
which we saw the next moment within
a few feet of the wagon. Drove on, took
in the pointer and went back with
Robin. I killed right and left as they rose
C. missing both barrels. The birds alighted
near together and at the next rise I made
a second double and then killed a single
bird. C. killed one single and we both
shot a fifth bird getting all five down
within a few seconds. After this I missed
four shots in succession at single birds and
killed one alone and one with C. We
got eleven birds from the bevy. The woods
were perfectly open with thin grass in
which I saw several of the birds before
they rose. Robin worked very finely pointing
nearly every bird.
  After lunch Nelly found two bevies,
one in a weed patch, one on a knoll in
