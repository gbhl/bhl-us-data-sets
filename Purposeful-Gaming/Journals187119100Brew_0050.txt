1886
May 23.
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Sunday
  Clear and decidedly the warmest day
of the season thus far.
  In the morning took a short drive and
heard a Tennessee Warbler singing on Monument
St. Several Black-poll Warblers and a Wood
Pur[?] were also singing in the orchard, and
I heard a Cuckoo there in the afternoon.
  The Black-poll was heard here yesterday
morning also.
