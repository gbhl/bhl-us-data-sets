be a committee to represent the association in matters 
of traffic. 
A. U. Chaney, general manager of the American 
Cranberry Exchange, addressed the meeting upon the 
sugar situation and other matters of Vital interest to 
growers. Each state will be allowed sugar in proportion 
to its population (2 pounds per capita per month) . There 
will be no change in that rule before December, and per- 
haps not then. No family or person is supposed to buy 
or have on hand more than one week's supply at any one 
time. Experiments have been made with substitutes of 
sugar for cranberry sauce. Half sugar and half white 
corn syrup is the most practical substitute. The Ameri- 
can Cranberry Exchange will institute a national adver- 
tising campaign to introduce the use of white corn syrup 
with cranberries. 
It is believed that the jobbers will take hold of the 
first round of cranberries, but if they do not sell readily 
then the risk of future sales is serious. The question of 
price will not enter into the sale of cranberries this year, 
in the opinion of the speaker. 
A letter from H. B. Scannel, secretary of the Amer- 
ican Cranberry Growers' Association of New Jersey, was 
read which placed the crop of New Jersey at between 
90,000 and 75,000 barrels. 
V. A. Saunders of the U. S. Agricultural Dept., Bu- 
reau of Crop Estimates, gave the following figures in re- 
gard to the New England crop. Last year the crop was 
about 120,000 barrels. Reports of crop this year indi- 
cate that one half the crop was killed by the frost of June 
20; insect injury has been less than usual. 
The 1918 estimate of the crop as indicated from re- 
ports from growers is 172,800 barrels. 
In Wisconsin the crop is estimated at 44,000 barrels. 
The acreage in Massachusetts is estimated to be 
14,000 acres, a large proportion of which is bog in poor 
condition.
