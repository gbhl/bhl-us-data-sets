OTTAWA, September 8, 1905. 
Hon. raymond prefontaine, K.C., 
Minister of Marine and Fisheries. 
sir,-i have the honour to submit herewith my report on the 
expedition to Hudson Bay and northward thereof, in the 
steamship Neptune; to which, on your kind recommendation, 
I was appointed officer in charge by a commission authorized 
under an order in council of August 13, 1903. 
Permit me to here acknowledge the kindly and valuable 
assistance afforded me by Colonel F. Gourdeau, Deputy Minis- 
ter of the Department of Marine and Fisheries, by Commander 
G. O. V. Spain, and by all the officers of the department at 
Ottawa and Halifax, with whom it was my duty and privilege 
to work. 
The greater part of the credit for the complete and successful 
accomplishment of all the instructions for the voyage is due to 
Captain S. W. Bartlett, the officers and the crew of the 
Neptune. Their prompt and cheerful attention to orders and 
their willing co-operation in all matters relating to the expedi- 
tion deserve the highest praise. 
I have great pleasure in calling attention to the valuable 
work of the scientific staff of the expedition. Dr. L. E. Borden, 
by his skill and attention, kept everybody in a good general 
state of health, and in addition rendered great assistance in the 
collection of specimens and data relating to ethnology, botany 
and zoology. Mr. Andrew Halkett, Naturalist of the Depart- 
ment of Marine and Fisheries, was indefatigable in the work 
of collecting specimens in all branches of natural history. Mr. 
C. F. King, who was attached from the staff of the Geological 
Survey, took charge in an able manner of the topographical 
work, and was willingly assisted by Messrs. Caldwell and ross 
and by the officers of the ship.
