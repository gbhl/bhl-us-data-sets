1888
May 24
Oden, Michigan
Clear and hot. Wind N. E. but light. Ther. 78[degrees].
  Started out at 7.30 as usual and spent about two
hours in the woods and thickets near the house, most
of this time in the woods to the south along the lake shore.
The great flight is about over although there were a few
small flocks of migrants in most of the coves. Dwight
got a [female] Vireo philadelphicus in the grove by the bath house
and I am very sure I saw another in the woods to
the south. In these woods I shot two [female] Dend. tigrina
and a Hel. peregrinia. Wilson's Black-caps and Canada
Warblers were comparatively scarce. Migrating D. maculosa
still numerous but nearly all were [female].
  There has been a marked change in the vegetation
since yesterday, many of the deciduous trees in the woods
showing a decided tinge of green this morning. The birches
and poplars are still hung thickly with catkins. The
white Trilliums are in their fullest perfection. Some purple
violets out to-day. The dog-tooth violet still in bloom
  About 10 A. M. started with D. to visit the Pigeon's nest
which he found yesterday. It was on the stout horizontal
branch of a hemlock about 12 ft. out & perhaps 50 above
the ground. There was no bird on but as D. was preparing
to climb the tree a [male] Pigeon started put of the next tree,
a hemlock also. He flew a few rods and alighted high
up on a horizontal hemlock branch where I shot him.
He flew nearly thirty yards before coming to the ground
& when he finally reached it struck against a n upright
dead prong tearing open his breast, or rather crop
which was filled with sprouting beech nuts.
  Upon reaching the nest D. found it empty & fouled
with dung. At about the same time a young Pigeon
