unequal. Walls of corallites thin but less so where they bound the 
calyces. Septa lamallar, apparently 12 in number, of two sizes, 
primary and secondary, alternating, the former stout and relatively 
large, the latter rudimentary and observed with difficulty, especially 
in the calyces where the six primary septa are paramountly evident, 
are slightly exsert and apparently connect with the nearest and cor- 
x20 
responding ones of contiguous corallites. Pores relatively large, oval, 
their greater diameter vertical, in a single longitudinal row between 
each pair of primary septa so as to interrupt the continuity of the 
secondary septa which are greatly reduced and in transverse sections 
are only observed in places. Tabulae not numerous, in the form of 
simple, flat transverse diaphragms. 
The two type Specimens have a maximum length of 50 and 70 
mm. with a thickness or height of 25 and 30 mm. respectively.
