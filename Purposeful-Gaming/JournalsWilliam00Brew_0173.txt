1888
Oct. 12
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Left Lakeside at 4. A. M. and went throu-
gh to Cambridge before dark. Day rain-
y and dark with S. E. wind. In the
Notch saw two Grouse one a fine old
"drummer" walked deliberately across
the road his tail raised and spread
like a fan his ruffs twitching, shaking
his head as if he were trying to dis-
locate his neck. When the horses were
within two feet of him he stopped
and stood erect and still looking
like a bunch of withered leaves. After
we passed he began picking at
some berries. Saw very few small
birds during the drive.
