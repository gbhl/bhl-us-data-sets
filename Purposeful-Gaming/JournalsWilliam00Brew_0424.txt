(Dec. 6)
leaf-carpeted ground. The Grouse was a very red bird, a
fine young cock in good plumage. I shall preserve the skin.
  After lunch at the house I went out again in the
direction of the river. The wind had changed into the
N. W. and blew fresh and cold over the bleak hills. A
few wild Meadow Larks and some Tree Sparrows were
the only birds I could find. At length I met Barnard
who offered to row one across the river to a salt marsh
where Meadow Larks congregate at evening to spend the
night. As we approached the place a flock of fully 15
rose from the marsh and crossed the river. We followed
and I landed and stalked them but they rose at
fully 80 yds. and I fired both barrels at three in 
rain. Herring Gulls were flying about over the creeks
calling ca-ca-ca and cle-ew
  Returned to the house by land over the hills. As
I was skirting the woods where I saw the Grouse this
morning "Dandy" suddenly stopped and pointed on the
edge of some pines. Although fully 200 yds. ahead of me
he held his point until I reached and passed him when
a Grouse rose from among the pines. The dog was evidently
standing on the scent of its feet where it had been
feeding in a bed of bear berry (here called Partridge berry).

Clear and a beautiful day.
  Rose before daylight and took the 7.30 train from
W. Barnstable station for Boston, the Captain driving
me over. Saw a flock of Juncos and heard a
Downy Woodpecker on the way.
