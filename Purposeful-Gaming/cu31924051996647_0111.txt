TIMOTHY 89 
YIELD OF SEED 
The yield of all grass seeds is very variable. Three 
bushels of timothy-seed (a bushel weighs about 45 
lbs. ) is considered a low yield, five is fair, and eight 
is good. Yields of ten or twelve bushels are sometimes 
obtained. When sown for purposes of seed-growing 
four to six quarts of seed (six to nine pounds) only 
is used. The price of the seed varies considerably, 
but it is always so low that it costs less to seed an acre 
of timothy than of any other grass. This is probably 
one reason why American farmers grow timothy almost 
to the exclusion of other hay grasses.
