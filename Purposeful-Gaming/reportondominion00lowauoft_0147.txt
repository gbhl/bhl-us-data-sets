HISTORICAL SUMMARY 
On his second voyage Davis coasted the American shore from 
the 67th to the 57th degree of latitude, but added nothing to 
his previous discoveries to the northward of Hudson strait. 
Keeping near the Greenland coast, on his way northward, Davis 
on his third voyage reached latitude 72 15'. The northern 
coast of Greenland he called the London coast. Leaving this, 
he sailed west for forty leagues, where he fell in with the ice of 
the ' middle pack ' of the Whalers; a strong gale then forced him 
south along the edge of the ice, so that no land was seen either 
to the west or north. 
George weymouth was the next adventurer to seek the north- 
west passage. .He was fitted out by the Muscovy company in 
1602. On the 28th of June, in the Discovery, he reached 
Warwicks island, between Frobisher and Cumberland bays, 
and sailing northward he passed Cape Walsingham and nearly 
reached the 69th parallel, when the crew mutinied and forced 
him to return south. Passing around Hatton headland on 
Resolution island, he sailed a considerable distance up Hudson 
strait, and then returned to England, where he arrived on the 
5th of August. 
Captain John Knight, in the Hopewell, sailed in 1606, but 
the voyage terminated speedily and disastrously by the death of 
Knight, his mate and three of the crew, who were surprised and 
slain by the Eskimos. 
Undeterred by these unsuccessful attempts, Sir John wol- 
stenholme and Sir Dudley Digges, in 1610, resolved to employ 
the Discovery, of fifty-five tons, in searching for the northwest 
passage, and nominated Henry Hudson to the command. He 
had proved his worth on previous voyages to Spitzbergen and 
to the Hudson river. On this, the last of his voyages, he first 
sighted the south shores of Greenland; eleven days later he 
entered Frobisher bay, but was soon turned back by ice, and so 
passed south into Hudson strait, which he followed westward 
into Ungava bay, where he was greatly obstructed by ice. Pass-
