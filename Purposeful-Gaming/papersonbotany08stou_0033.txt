NEW DAY LILIES 
Numerous new varieties of day lilies (Hemerocallis) have re- 
cently been developed at The New York Botanical Garden 
through hybridization. These plants extend considerably the 
range in the color, size, and shape of the flowers for this group 
of ornamentals and include a goodly number of hybrids whose 
flowers are pleasing and attractive. The results already realized 
indicate that the rather simple flower colors of the older species 
may be broken up, recombined, and even intensified through hy- 
bridization, thus producing an increased diversity and yielding 
new forms of special interest and value to the flower-grower. 
The list of day lilies available for general garden culture and 
for breeding purposes is not a long one. There are, however, 
about ten recognized species in cultivation to begin with. Of 
these the lemon day lily (Hemerocallis flava) with its fragrant 
and clear yellow flowers and the still more common orange day 
lily (H. fulva) are best known. The record of their culture in 
Europe extends back nearly 500 years. Possibly they were 
brought to Europe from Asia as early as the time of Marco Polo. 
In recent years other species have been brought from the Old 
World to the New. 
Of them all, Hemerocallis fulva has the gayest flowers. In this 
the throat of a flower is deep chrome, outside of which there is a 
zone of English red extending with decreasing intensity to the tip 
of the six flower segments. The pattern is fairly well indicated 
in Figure 2 (the middle flower of the upper row). The flower 
is bi-colored with the chrome and the red in conspicuous contrast.
