WHAT I HAVE DONE WITH BIRDS 
was squarely on the ground of Nuttall, who said that, "wantonly 
to destroy these delightful aids to sentimental happiness ought 
to be viewed not only as an act of barbarity, but almost as sacri- 
lege." Knowing what the destruction of a single Vireo egg 
meant to Bob, I went with all possible haste. 
He was angrier even than I had feared, for the Cow-bird had 
eaten one Vireo egg and, in depositing her own, cracked another. 
He had a little bowl-shaped paddle whittled out and ready, and 
on my advice scooped out the broken egg, lest it soil the contents 
of the nest in bending down the limb. We tied the branch se- 
curely and in a short time the two Vireo eggs and the big speckled 
one were on record. Scarcely had the shutter clicked when Bob 
scooped out the Cow-bird egg, dropped it on the ground and vin- 
dictively set his heel on it. I shuddered to think of the picture he 
was spoiling by not letting that egg hatch, but there was no use 
asking him to leave it. There are times when Bob can say no, 
and he had reached the limit when he left two Cow-bird eggs in 
the Warbler's nest. 
"I'm glad that's over," said Bob, drawing a long breath. "I'll 
not stand having this little gray soul pestered again. If that 
Cow-bird comes here to-morrow I'll take my shot-gun and blow 
her to atoms." 
In a few minutes the Vireo was on the edge of her nest, peep- 
ing inquiringly into it to see what had happened next, and it 
really looked as if she ruffled her feathers with satisfaction as she 
settled to brood on her two eggs. 
The next morning, Bob kept his word and stood guard. He 
did not see the Cow-bird; but following his line of nests down the 
bank, when he thought all danger to the Vireo was over, found 
that this bird of brass had made a house-warming party all by
