  Clear and still; rather warm at noon (the 80 [degrees])
  Down river by boat with E. H. and W. D., starting
at 9.30 and spending the day, returning just

  As we passed through Great Meadow the
only birds singing were an occasional Song Sparrow
or Grass Finch, a Savanna Sparrow, and a Short-
billed Marsh Wren, the latter in the long meadow grass
very near where I found a Flicker's and Bobolinks
nests in June. It is strange than I have not heard
him before but possible that he has only just
come into the meadow or begun to sing. While stopping
to listen to him Mr. H. stepped ashore and a few
feet out into the meadow when a Woodcock rose
directly underfoot from the tall grass.

  In an uncut bed of Canary Grass a Virginia Rail
uttered its grunting song (?) several times as we passed.
At the bend below Dakin's Hill we flushed a
Green Heron and at the swift reach below I saw
two Night Heron's flying and heard a Nighthawk
which was evidently flying also, well out over the
meadow. Below Ball's Hill a Red-tailed Hawk
appeared, soaring at a moderate height, screaming
loudly. Besides these there were Red-wings in
large flocks in the Zizania, Bobolinks in small
companies chinking over the meadow, and a few 
Barn, Cliff and White-bellied Swallows skimming about.

  We landed about a mile below Ball's Hill &
went to the pine woods on the plateau which looked
less remarkable now that I have seen the
Sudbury pines. In them I found a mixed flock
