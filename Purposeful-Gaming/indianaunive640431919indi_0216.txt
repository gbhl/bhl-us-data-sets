Of the 100 defectives used for this study only 22 are or have 
been in the School for Feeble-minded Youth, altho in almost every 
case, excepting the males over sixteen who are not eligible, all 
effort has been made to secure application. 
Two of the reasons for failure are: first, the unwillingness 
of the parents to send their children to the institution; and, 
second, the amount of time and work necessary for a social worker 
to put upon such a case to complete the details. When there is 
an insufficiency of workers, such tasks are apt to be neglected. 
If less than 25 per cent of these cases diagnosed in the State 
Hospital and City Dispensary reach the proper institution, is it 
not indicative of an error in the system? It is hoped that the 
law passed by the 1919 legislature making admission by court 
commitment instead of application by parent or guardian as 
formerly, together with the provision for a new and larger insti- 
tution, will aid Indiana to care for more than 7.1 per cent of her 
mental defectives. 
Table II shows that of the 100 individuals in this group there 
are 57 males and 43 females. The table shows ages also.
