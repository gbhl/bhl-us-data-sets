Sept. 16
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
[margin]Head of Lake[/margin]
Clear and warm with light S.E. wind.
  To the outlet by steamer with Spelman taking James Burnier, Will Sargent
and Chas. Tidswell the guides who went to get our camping ground in
order. Landed at the first point south of Moll's Rock and the men
at once went to work to clear a place for the tents while S & T
sat on a log and directed operations. It was very pleasant,
the sunlight streaming down through the foliage , a Kingfisher
rattling on the lake shore, Titmice and Warbler chirping
in the woods.

  After eating lunch we started for the Outlet where we
beat the marshes for about two hours without seeing a
single game bird of any kind. I started several Swamp
and Savannah Sparrows as well as three Titlarks.
  We then started for Lakeside, Spelman rowing, On 
the way we saw nothing whatever of any interest.

  Reached Lakeside about 5 p.m. and kept on into 
the lower pond at the mouth of the Cambridge.
On the south shore of this pond is a little muddy
cove where we have seen a flock of Wood Ducks on
several occasions lately. They proved to be there this
evening and I stalked them successfully after waiting
some time for a drake, which sat perched on a log, probably
as a sentinel, to join the others which were swimming close
in to the grass. Getting three together I fired Killing them all
and dropping a fourth with the other barrel as the survivors
rose. This was my first fair shot at Ducks with the new
20g gun. there were about twelve birds in this flock.

  While here I heard a White-throated Sparrow sing and
what surprised me considerably the full flight song of
an Oven-bird. This was after sunset, the evening 
cloudy and warm. Swamp Sparrows were also trilling but
in broken feeble tones.
