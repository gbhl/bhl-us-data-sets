in the same manner but I also made
many bad misses. I bagged a fine [?] Bald-pate 
that came directly to the decoys and shot
a [female symbol?] Gadwal that was passing rather high
overhead. By four o'clock I had used all
my shells (100) and taking up the decoys
we started for home first skirting the shores
and picking up the birds that had 
drifted off. On counting them I found I
had bagged just thirty-five in all. Probably
six or eight wounded ones escaped.
  During the entire day Prairie Warblers were 
singing in the mangroves behind my
stand. I also heard a Quail whistling
bob-white - bob-white, doubling this usual 
whistle each time. Can this be characteristic 
of the Florida bird?
  A number of Brown Pelicans came near
my stand during the day, some within 
twenty yards or less. Royal Terns were
also rather numerous. On the way down 
the bay in the morning I saw a Red-head
among some Scaups and identified it
beyond any doubt by means of my glass.
It was either a [female symbol] or an immature male.
  Cory went to Pepper Hamack where he
shot a [infant?] Heron which seems to me to
be A. herodias [verus?] and which he kindly 
gave me. He also started a Barn Owl from
a palmetto. Quarterman says they are
always to be found in this hamack. I
shall test this to-morrow.
  C. saw a cream colored Coot to-day
