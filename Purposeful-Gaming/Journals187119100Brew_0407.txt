  Started for home just before sun-set Melvin 
leading our boat by twenty minutes. He shot a Great Blue
Heron and saw five musk-rats. We saw literally nothing 
but a few Juncos. It was dark when we reached the landing. 
October 20. Clear, still and warm. I spent the day in the
house working on birds. Melvin went to the Foy place and
walked in to C. Pond. He saw eight Grouse, about twelve
Canada Jays and one Pileated Woodpecker. 
October 21. Cloudy and warm with high wind. A blank day. 
Drove up to Morse's run after dinner and beat for Woodcock 
but failed to find any. Saw five Robins. Returned and 
walked out on the Tyler road beyond the bog. Woods silent
and deserted. Saw only a few Blue Jays. 
October 22. Clear and warm. A high gusty wind. Went
down river and out to Birchpoint in the forenoon. No Ducks 
in the Lake. Returning saw a Solitary, a Titlark and a 
Wilson's Snipe near together on a mud-flat. Shot all three.

bank. Shot all three sitting, one flying up to a bush, the 
third running at my first shot. Further up shot a female
Picoides arcticus and a female Hylotomus. Returning shot
