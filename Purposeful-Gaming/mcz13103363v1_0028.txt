Brown Thrush
[margin]May 7, 1865[/margin]
   [delete]One shot, by W. D.
in [?]. I saw it myself[/delete]
  Saw one and heard two
in the country they are
called planting birds because
the arrive about planting
time and because of
their song. this song which
I have heard myself
resembles the following.
hole it, hole it, hole it,
drop it, drop it, drop it,
cover it up, cover it up,
cover it up.
Of course it requires a
 good deal of imagination
to interpret it thus & 
besides the words are
interrupted by various
twitterings and other
flourishes of a like nature.
These birds inhabit bushy
tract and seem to have
a partiality to musshy
ground; they are reddish
brown above white beneath
with speckled breasts
and long bills and tails.
