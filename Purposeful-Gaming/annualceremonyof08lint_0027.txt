ANNUAL CEREMONY OF THE PAWNEE MEDICINE MEN 15 
monies. All the beds and other furniture were carried 
out by the women, and the floor swept. When this had 
been done, the medicine men seated themselves in front 
of the lodge altar and sent their errand men to notify 
the other members of the society. After these had 
arrived and taken their places, the leaders went to each 
of them in turn and directed them, in a whisper, to

either side of the entrance. The framework was made 
of pieces of ashwood lashed together with sinew. Over 
these a layer of grass was laid, and the whole covered

colors. The mouth of the figure was so large that a 
man could crawl into it, and was provided with pointed 
teeth, also of ashwood. On each side of the mouth, 
long, slender willow-rods were stuck to represent
