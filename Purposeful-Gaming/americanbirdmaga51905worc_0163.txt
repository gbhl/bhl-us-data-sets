OUR BIRDS WILL YET RETURN. 
Hattie Washburn, Goodwin, S. D. 
Why moan the winds so sadly 
Amid the naked trees? 
Why rush the leaves so madly 
Before the chilly breeze? 
Why are the skies so dreary 
In somber robes of gray, 
And flowers with life grown weary 
Have sadly passed away. 
Why are the birds all winging 
Their weary southward flight? 
No more we hear them singing 
Their songs of pure delight. 
The stern Frost King is sailing 
Across his frozen sea 
And Nature sad is wailing 
To see her minstrels flee. 
But the sun follows the rain, 
Each night a day shall know, 
There's a balm for ev'ry pain, 
An end to ev'ry woe. 
So the Spring will shine once more, 
Our hearts will cease to yearn. 
With songs joyous as before 
Our birds will yet return.
