1889
March 30
Thomasville, Georgia.
Clear and warm with light south wind.
  Hiring a saddle horse I spent two hours
or more of the forenoon riding through the
woods near town. The country is nearly level
with no decided hills or hollows. The soil is sandy,
the woods chiefly of pines (almost entirely Pinus australis)
which grows rather openly (but not as scattering
as in lower Florida) with a few oaks (chiefly
black jack) intermingled. The ground beneath
is grassy with  many low bushes and vines in
places. I saw no palmetto.
  Birds were fairly numerous. I heard Tufted Titmice,
Cardinals, Carolina Wrens etc. and two Peucaeas,
the latter singing in low pines about 200 yds.
apart. They were in full song and I spent
several minutes listening to their delightful
music. I also saw a pair of Vireo flavifrons
in an oak, both silent hopping from twig to
twig peering about under the opening leaves in
the usual listless indolent manner.
  We left Thomasville for the north at 1 p.m.
