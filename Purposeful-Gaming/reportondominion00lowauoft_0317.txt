GEOLOGY 207 
Cape Granite is the northern boundary of the granite, which 
retains the same character as far as Howe harbour. It is com- 
posed of quartz, red feldspar and dark-green chlorite, and is 
accompanied with gneiss of the same composition.' 
' The granitoid rocks extend across Peel sound into Prince 
of Wales island in the form of a dark syenite, composed of 
quartz, greenish-white feldspar passing into yellow, and horn- 
blende.' 
ISLANDS OF GROUP Iv. 
Archaean rocks are found only in the eastern part of this 
group, on the large islands of Ellesmere and North Devon. 
They rise from beneath the newer rocks on the south side of 
Hayes sound a few miles north of Cape Sabine, and then 
occupy the remainder of the eastern coast of Ellesmere and that 
of north Devon. This area appears to form a wedge-shaped 
mass expanding southward, so that on Jones and Lancaster 
sounds they extend a -considerable distance to the westward, 
until they become capped by limestone, and then gradually sink 
below the level of the sea. 
Both the Laurentian and Huronian divisions of the archaean 
are represented in the area. A series of bedded rocks consisting 
of several thousand feet of sandstones, limestones and other 
sediments occupies the coast and islands of the east side of 
smith sound, from Cape Atholl northward to Foulke fiord. On 
the west side the northern limit of these rocks is Cape Isabella, 
from which they occupy the shore of Ellesmere for upwards of 
twenty miles to the south, the southern limit not having yet 
been determined on that side. 
These bedded rocks are associated with dark coloured traps 
and diabase, which are present in the form of sills between the 
bedding; as dikes cutting the bedded rocks and as large intru- 
sive masses. Dr. Sutherland classified these rocks as the 
equivalents of the Tertiary sandstones of Disko on account of
