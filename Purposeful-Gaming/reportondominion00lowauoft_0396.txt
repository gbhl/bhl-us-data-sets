274: cruise OF THE NEPTUNE 
this account is disliked by the Whalers, as the presence of a 
single Killer means the immediate flight of all creatures in that 
vicinity. Luckily it will not penetrate among the heavy floes, 
.where the Right whales retreat for safety, Some idea of the 
destruction to life caused by the Killer may be formed from the 
fact that in the stomach of one were found fourteen porpoises 
and fourteen large seals; it choked to death swallowing the 
fifteenth. They chase seals and White whales on shore, and the 
seals are often seen jumping clear out of water in their endea- 
vour to escape. 
porpoises. 
Phocacna communis, brookes.-the porpoise arrives on the 
Greenland coast early in the spring, but does not go north of 
latitude 69 n., nor does it frequent the ice-laden seas of Baffin 
bay; it is unknown in Hudson strait and bay. 
Beluga catadon, gray.-the White whale or White porpoise 
(Kellulauak, Eskimo) is common to all the Arctic coasts, and 
remains throughout the year. It usually travels in large schools, 
frequenting the bays and mouths of rivers. In the north large 
numbers have been taken by the Whalers along the coast of 
North Somerset, both in Prince Regent inlet and in Barrow 
strait. It is plentiful in the rivers at the heads of Cumberland 
gulf and Frobisher bay. Many are killed annually by the 
natives along the south shore of Hudson strait. The Hudson's 
Bay Company has for several years past made successful fish- 
eries in the mouth of the Koksoak river and in Leaf bay, both 
in the southwest part of Ungava bay. Similar fisheries were 
formerly conducted in the mouths of Great and Little Whale 
rivers on the east side of Hudson bay, but after some success 
the whales would not enter these rivers over the nets, and the 
fisheries were abandoned. The writer has seen great numbers 
of White whales in the mouths of the rivers to the northward of
