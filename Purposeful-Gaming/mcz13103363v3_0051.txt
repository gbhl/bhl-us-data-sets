  Pleasant, warm, and altogether
a most lovely day. Ther. 34[degrees] -

great deal and the water ran
merrily. The snow remains on 
the ground only in small
patches and drifts. Went to church
and sabbath school in A.M.
and was late to the latter.
In the P.M. took a walk up into
Watertown and back again round
Mt. Auburn. Saw a good many
blue birds, gold finches, snow birds
purple finches and song sparrows.
Saw the first fox colored sparrow.
When I got home saw a crow blackbird
in the elm trees on Spark's St. Read
most of the evening. Went to 
bed at 9.30 P.M.
Had lettuce for the first time this year.
