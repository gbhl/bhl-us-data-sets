1886
June 15
  Cloudy and cool. Wind N.E. with fine rain
at intervals.
  Started down river at about 10 oclock, taking
lunch and spending most of the day. On the way
down I landed at the Old Maples near "the tent"
and found them alive with birds of several spe-
cies which were apparently preying on insects in-
festing the leaves. Among others was a fine â™‚
Tanager. The majority were Orioles, Cuckoos and
Bobalinks. I shot all but one of the above specimens
in these trees and might easily have doubled the
number. Continuing on, I visited the Flicker's
nest and found the young gone.
  I next landed at Ball's Hill where I got noth-
ing but a Yellow Warbler. The woods were gloomy
and wet, but many common birds were singing.
In fact it was a remarkably good singing day
from morning to night.
  In the swamp behind the hill, the Canada
Flycatcher was in full song. Over the Great Meadow
Swallows were skimming in large numbers, perhaps
a hundred in all including Chimney Swift.
  Just below Dakin's Hill I saw some Wood Ducks
in the usual place.  All four were positively drakes.
  The shallow water inshore under the overhang-
ing maples was strewn with their feathers.
