directly towards me turning not the slightest to
either side flapping its wings steadily and evidently
making what haste it could, poor bird! Where I came 
it was actually within ten feet of my head and 
I had to wait until it got the proper distance
before firing. If fell wounded but only threatened
me with its talons making us decided attempt
at striking.
  After launching in my boat at the white maple
bird I paddled down past Ball's Hill nearly
opposite which I spied at Cost feeding among
the lily-pads in shore, nodding its head prettily
at cade stroke of the feet. One seeing me it 
swam out and for a long distance kept ahead
of me only using where the boat was within ten
yards. I shot it as it was flying off.
  I next killed a Kingfisher that  tried to pass
me in shore, then sailed a mile or more down 
the long reach and back. This reach was dotted
in many direction with Grebe (P podiceps) although
I had seen only one in the river above. 
  Returning I landed to beat the Swiper ground
at about 4 P.M. Meadow at green and level as a 
billiard table with silky streamer of balloon(?)
spiders gleaning in the slanting sunbeams, It lasts
whirling about piping feebly, and a flock of Meadow
Larks sunning there yellow breasts among the tussocks.
[margin]Swipe shooting[/margin]
  Started about twelve swipe and shot six, all larger
fine birds, making two straight double shots. Also
missed a number of long shots at high birds. Have
rarely seen Swipe so wild as these were, at least in clear
weather. They often rose surreal hundred yards away (see note)
