1886
May 5
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Cloudy and warm, with south wind.
Thunder shower in P.M.
  There was a heavy rush of emigrants to-day,
in fact, the country was fairly alive with birds.
I heard several newcomers singing at day-
break and saw a Wood Thrush hopping about
on the ground under the lilacs after breakfast.
  My day was doomed to be a broken one as
I had an engagement in Boston at three O'
clock, so I did not attempt any collecting but
merely took a drive in the forenoon, going up
around the "Parker Lot." Least Flycatchers were
singing in the orchards. Brown Thrashers and
Towhees in the pastures, Creepers (Minotitta)
Nashville Warblers and Chestnut sided Warblers in 
the woods. I also heard a Grosbeak and a 
Yellow Warbler; Doubtless there were many more
new comers, but I had little chance to detect
them. Chimney Swifts flying about over the
town in the evening.
  The vegetation is remarkably advanced for
the season. Cherry trees have been in bloom
more than a week (they opened in Cambridge
April 23rd and by April 25th were in full bloom.)
Peach trees are also out, and Apple trees in the
orchard here show a few expanded blossoms.
In the woods the shad bush is still in full flow-
er, (I saw the first blossom April 27th) The 
poplars are dense with foliage, the birches cast
a slight shade and some of the oaks have
already expanded a few leaves, while their
swollen buds give the trees a delicate pink
