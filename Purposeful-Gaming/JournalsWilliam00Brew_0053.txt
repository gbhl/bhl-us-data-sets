Oden, Michigan
Sunday
Clear still & the warmest day here. Ther. 66[degrees] at noon.
  Near the bath house this morning saw a
Tennessee Warbler, a Cat Bird answering behind the
house. Two King Birds & Chimney Swifts probably fresh
arrivals. At 8 A. M. birds singing rather finely
Yellow rumps, H. [?]capilla, a Water Thrush etc.
  Spent most of the day in the house.
In the afternoon took a boat and rowed around
the great island. Landing at its western end
found there the largest flock of Warblers seen
here this far. There was a single Tennessee among
them. The bulk of the flock was composed of
Yellow-rumps & Nashvilles, with a Minotilla, two
Redstarts & one D. Palmarum. (The latter species
was nearly as abundant in the clearing as on
 yesterday)
  At the west end of the island saw a larger
number of Ducks including about 30 Mergus americanus
(three fine drakes), 15 Lophodytes crenellatus, & ten or twelve
Whistlers. Two Loons & a Cormorant near the
middle of the lake. Picked up a primary of a
Barred Owl on the island.
  The shore of Crooked Lake are wooded chiefly
with arbor vitae & remind me of those of
B. Pond; the trees green to the water's edge.
  Twp Hylotomus calling in the woods opposite
the house at sunset.
  A white Trillium in flower to-day.
