Char and rather cool with stiff N. wind.
After breakfast we all started out in our 
canoes, Chapman leading.  He went down river
about a mile and had the bare good luck to
kill an Ivory-billed Woodpecker with his first 
shot hearing it pounding and calling in the 
cypresses through only a few yards? from the river
and stalking it easily enough.
I landed about half a mile down and found?
a number of Warblers among which I shot a 
â™€ Bachman's.  Proth???? ??? rather ????
along the river but I heard ??? him going
I then went further down landing by chance 
at the very place where Chapman killed his
Woodpecker.  There was many birds here, also, 
but I found nothing worth shooting.  In this
swamp I heard a loud, harsh cry replicated 
every few seconds.  I suspected that i might
be an Ivory-bill and ???? cautiously in 
keeping a sharp look out in the trees
but at length discovered then author of them
found at my feet.  It was a small frog
which a smaller garter snake was trying to 
swallow feet first.  ??? little ??? the snake 
would open its mouth wider and try to 
suck the frog further when he would cry
out as already described.  I finally put my 
foot on the snake when he let go his hold
and the frog went off with long a 
doubtless joyful jumps.
Chapman joined me in time for lunch 
which we ate on a forest at the mouth
