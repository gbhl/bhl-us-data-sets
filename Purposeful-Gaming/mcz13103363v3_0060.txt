windy particularly in the
P.M. when it blew a perfect
hurricane. Ther. 36[degrees] - 50[degrees] - 38[degrees].
When I got home from school
worked for some time on a bird
house. Got up at 5.30 A.M. &
studied until breakfast.
After dinner went shooting.
Killed a robin with a stone.
Saw a pine creeping warbler, a male
barn swallow (for the first time).
Saw also a fish hawk, several
fox colored sparrows, a tree sparrow,
and several snow birds. Caught a
very large turtle but let him go again. Studied
at the Russell's in the evening

Caesar (review).

Not so much as an inch

Was dismissed (with the rest of
the history class) a hour early
to-day. Spent the time before
dinner in putting up a bird
house. Rode up to Lexington on
Tiger in P.M. starting as soon
as I had got my dinner.
On the way home, saw a musk
rat swim across the Glacialis
and another across the 'Musk
rat pond'. Got home at 7 P.M. Played
ball in the pasture till 7.45
and then had my supper by
myself. The fields are all
quite green. Studied from 8.25 P.M.
