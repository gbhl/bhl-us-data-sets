1887
May 12
Concord, Massachusetts.
A repetition of yesterday, clear, cool, with a roaring
N.W. wind.
  Off at 9:30 to Sandy Pond woods in pursuit
especially of Wood Thrashers. Drove several miles
through swamps, wood road etc. finally crossing
to the turnpike. Saw almost nothing except
a few common birds. Fired only one shot, at a Vireo
solitarious which I killed. Heard a D.maculosa and 
a Hel. Chrysoptera, the latter in Hall's birches. The 
woods at times were perfectly silent and seemed
deserted but of course it was owning wholly to 
the weather which was the worst possible for
collecting. I heard singing a few D. Pennsylvania
D. vireos, Surus aureapillus, Minotitt vireo,
Thrashers, Catbirds, and our Parula. Althogether
the trip proved a total failure for I neither
saw nor heard a Wood Thrush.
  Up Assabet in the canoe late in P. M. nearly
dead silence there and few birds near. Started
two Spotted Landpipers and are Solitary, no
latter perching awkwardly on the top of a 
submerged button bush.
  In the Sandy Pond woods this morning
watched a pair of Chickadees digging a hole
in a poplar stump. Both came and went
bringing out shreds of dead wood, flying
a few rods and dropping them after alighting.
  No marked charger in the vegetation.
Chestnut leaves opening and many oaks
showing small light jungle leaves.
