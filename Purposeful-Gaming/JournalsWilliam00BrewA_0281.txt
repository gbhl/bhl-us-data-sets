Oct 19
  Cloudy with high S.E. wind and heavy rain in the evening. 
Spent the morning about camp. In the afternoon I 
sailed the canoe over to Pine Point Jim going with 
me in the boat. Landed and explored the point
for a camping site for next  year. In the rocky
cove saw a Spotted Sandpiper, the only one noted
here this autumn.

  I had intended to go to Moose Pt. for the
evening shooting but the weather looked so 
threatening that I decided to return to camp. 
Had an exciting sail across for the wind
came in strong gusts. Soon after we landed
it began blowing a gale which continued all
night with heavy rain.
