Sunday, March 3.
  Clear but rather windy & chilly.
Ther. 10 [degrees] - 26 [degrees] - 32 [degrees].
Went to sabbath school
in A.M. and got late.
Attended Dr. Newel's church
Walked up with C. Carter.
Read most of the P.M.
and evening. Mr. Coburn
came over in the P.M. &
stayed about an hour.
  The ground is now nearly
all bare in the fields but
the snow is still pretty
deep in the woods but as
it is solid the walking
is good enough. The
riding is very bad as the 
frost is coming out of the 
ground.
