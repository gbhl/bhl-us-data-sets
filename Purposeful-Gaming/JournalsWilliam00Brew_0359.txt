1889
July 7
Cambridge, Massachusetts.
 Morning clear. Afternoon cloudy at sunset. Evening
clear with pale moonlight. Warm and sultry with light
S.W. wind.
  To the swamps with Purdie this evening taking the 5.30
train to Hill's Crossing and returning by carriage from
Alwife Brook at 8.30 p.m. Went over the usual ground
walking down the Massachusetts Central track to the willow hedge
where we spent an hour or more, thence at sunset
to the Pout Pond swamp where we remained until
past eight o'clock.
  There has been a great change in both vegetation &
bird life since I last visited this swamp (June 14).
To-day we found Eupatorium. Night Shade, Lysimachia
stricta, and evening primrose in full bloom. The seal brown
heads of the cat-tail flags are of nearly full size and
very prominent contrasting with the sea of waving green
bladder-like leaves. Both species growing side by side in
places the narrow-leaved, dark green, the broad-leaved
a paler glaucous green.
  Song Sparrows and Swamp Sparrows were singing
incessantly in every direction when we first entered
the meadows, in fact much more vigorously than in
early June, but until after sunset we heard nothing
else except a few Maryland Yellow-throats and an occasional Cuckoo or Yellow Warbler
and still more rarer a Red-wing. The latter were seen
in numbers, however, in small flocks composed largely of
chattering young flying place to place in the
great meadow. A little before sunset Robins began
singing and continued until nearly dark. We also
noted a considerable flight going to roost in the
swamp at Pout Pond. Not a single Marsh Wren
