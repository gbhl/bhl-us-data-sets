behind and upon reaching the river dropped
suddenly and alighted on its edge.
None of the birds above mentioned seemed
much disturbed by the boat. No shooting
whatever, even at alligators, is now allowed
on the steamers.
  Of small birds we saw very few; Redwings
in large flocks feeding among the willows or
on the bonnets, occasional scattered parties
of Boat-tails and a few Swallows made
up the list.
  The scarcity of Eagles and Ospreys was
very noticeable. I saw not more than two
of the former and perhaps four or five of the
latter.
  It is doubtful how much of this paucity of
bird life is due to actual decrease or dispersion
of the birds by persecution and how much
to the exceptionally high stage of the water.
I am inclined to think the latter the
chief cause for the feeding grounds are all
flooded, in many cases for miles back.
  The lower part of the river was very
beautiful in the light of the setting sun.
The cypresses hung with Tillandsia which
had a warm pinkish tint in the cosy
light. After twilight fell the scene was
impressive, rather than beautiful, a wilderness
of forest and river bearing no signs of man's
presence or desecration for the timber scenes
not to have suffered much if at all on
this part of the river.
