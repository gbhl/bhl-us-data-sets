1888
Oct. 8.
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Cloudy all day with raging N. W. wind and
occasional light showers. Off at 10. A. M.
Went over the marshes first but saw noth-
ing of any interest there except a large
flock of Black Ducks which rose wild
One of them left the flock and alighted
in the river near Leonard's Pond. We had
forgotten it and was rowing carelessly
along when it rose only about 30 yds.
ahead. It alighted in Leonards Pond.
Going in after it we again got within
30 yds. before seeing it. It then rose and I
shot it. Next to Sweat Meadow. Entering this
saw four Black Ducks swim in behind
a point We were getting up to them surely
when several blasts were exploded at Errol
Dam. Our Ducks rose at once and from
the west side of the pond a perfect cloud'
went up fully 100 birds, all Black Ducks
they made off to the East. We pushed on
cautiously, however, and soon discovered
about 15 Black Ducks in the edge of the
grass. Jim pushed the canoe up with-
in about 40 yds when a Duck raised
its head. They were well bunched so
I fired at once stopping four with the
first barrel and cutting down a sin-
gle bird with the second. One of the
wounded soon rose and I shot her down
again at very long range. "Don" found
three of the wounded in the grass. We then
landed and while Jim was building
