approached the spot when "Robin" pointed. A bird
rose and I killed it when a bevy of at least a
dozen birds flushed. C. killed one and I missed
with the second barrel. We flushed only one of them
birds a second time C. missing it.
  After lunch I started out on foot taking the
pointer. First hunted some low scrub when I saw
three Florida Jays. Approaching an old field the
bitch drew and pointed. A moment later she flushed
the birds thirty yards off. I shot at one only &
marked it down wounded. The bitch found it &
made a pretty point which she held allowing me to
go in and pick up the bird. I could find only
one of this bevy in the oak scrub when they settled
but killed this one.
  Drove a mile or more through pine woods when the
bitch struck the scent on a running bevy roading them
some distance and finally pointing staunchly. C.
killed a brace, I only one, missing with my second
barrel.
  We then took up the pointer & put down the setters.
"Prince" soon found a bevy among palmetto. They rose
highly like scattered birds. C. shot a brace and I
three highs missing one. My last bird flew about 100
yds. and dropped dead in oak scrub where we found
him after some trouble. There ended the day's sport.
  In nearly all of the numerous small pine land
ponds that we passed were from one to eight or
ten Greebs (P. podiceps). We saw only one Heron, an 
adult A. caerulea. Sparrow Hawks were rather
numerous. Saw several large flocks of Carolina Doves.
Only one Meadow Lark seen to-day.
