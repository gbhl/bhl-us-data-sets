June 12
Winchendon, Massachusetts.
Clear and cool with strong N. W. wind.
  Left the town at 7.30 A. M. and reached Bailey's
about 9. After changing our things we started at once for
the wood following the main road down to the edge
of the great spruce swamp where we searched for nests
an hour or two without finding any. Although the
sun was shining the day was cool, almost chilly, a
fact which doubtless accounted for the silence of the birds.
We heard only a very few; in fact the woods seemed
deserted, although we heard a few D. virens and one D. blackburniae.
  We next crossed the road and made a long close
search for the nest of the Whippoorwill heard last night.
The [male] bird was speedily found and started in a cluster
of saplings which he had evidently been haunting for
some time to judge by the numerous droppings (of peculiar
shape & appearance not unlike Grouse's but smaller) on the
tops of some large rocks. We drove him from place to place
during our continued search but could not find the [female].
  After dinner we crossed the run below the house
and spent most of the afternoon on the [?]
timbered hillside beyond. At the spring found a pair of
Solitary Vireos at work on their nest which was in the

heard one D. blackburnaie & two D. virens. Bailey found
an Over Birds nest with 5 eggs & a Towhee's with one egg.
Returning heard the first Hermit Thrush in the pine 
run.
  Next tried the lane that passes the house. On its
