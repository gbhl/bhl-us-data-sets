Friday, July 5, 1867.
  Cloudy all day and
everything was dripping.
Ther. 62弉��64�
���60�. Rose only in time
for breakfast. Walked up
to the summer house after
breakfast & set a trap for
a red squirrel that had
taken up his abode there.
R[uth] Deane called in & spent
the first part of A.M. with me.
Then painted about 32
stands. After dinner went
up and saw J.N. & C. Carter
and spent most of the P.M.
there. My side is much
better. Currants are nearly
ripe, that is, the bunches are
about half red.

  Cloudy most of day. Cleared
up at about 3 P.M. Had
several showers in the
A.M. Ther. about 65弉��

examined my muskrat skins
and found that the moths had
eaten them. Put some camphor
in my cases. Then went up
to the Nichols' and C. Carter

red wing for me and a barn
swallow. Spent the A.M. up
waiting for him. In the
P.M. stuffed the red wing
for my cousin. Got five
eggs. Spent most of the evening
reading. Side almost entirely
well.
