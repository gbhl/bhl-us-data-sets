1889
Feb. 4
Enterprise, Florida
Clear and warm. Ther. 70[degrees] at noon.
  Spent the day Snipe shooting leaving the dogs
at home. Drove first to Horse Hill Prairie
where we started only six Snipe killing four
of them. Thence to Dago Prairie a long drive
through the pine woods, most of the way
following no road. Reaching the "prairie"
we beat down one side without starting
a bird. Then lunched in a isolated grove of
palmettos. After lunch heard heavy firing
on the other side of the prairies and driving
over there found Mr. Correns working a
brace of red setters and putting up Snipe in
great numbers. We were soon in the midst
of them and in the course of a half hour
bagged nine or ten birds each. Moving on
a few hundred yards we struck a fresh
lot and repeated the experience. All these
birds were scattered about and lay very
closely. Later in the afternoon, however, as
we were on our way out of the prairie
we started a perfect cloud of Snipe which
acted very oddly, [delete]f[/delete] rising at long range and
flitting on ahead a few rods at a time
Occasionally one or two would lie more
closely and after we had fired a few
shots and scattered the birds we had
fine shooting. I made two double shots
in succession and missed but few
birds all day. Our total bag was 44 snipe
of which I killed 25 and 4 Quail of which I
