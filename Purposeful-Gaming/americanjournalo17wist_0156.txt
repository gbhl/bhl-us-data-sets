The canines are also undergoing retrograde metamorphosis as 
indicated by their size in prehistoric times and today. The Fili- 
pinos and Indians, in whom the canines erupt early, are more 
like the prehistoric men than are the Germans and Americans, 
in whom the canines erupt late. The same is also true of the 
second and third molars, which also erupt earlier among the 
Filipinos and Indians than among the Germans and Americans. 
THE MORPHOLOGIC TYPE AND THE TEETH 
In a former study of Filipino students (2) I called attention 
to the bad teeth of what I then called the Iberian type, but 
have since named the hyper-onto-morph. This type is usually 
small, slender, narrow nosed, and has a long slender face with 
pointed chin, and a long narrow head with projecting occipital 
region, although at times the type may be fat, the face may be 
short and not slender, the nose may be stubby, and the head may 
be rounded; but at all times the type has characteristic ears, 
with everted anthelix, tragus and antitragus, and rolled back 
helix. The type is identical with the Mediterranean race of 
Sergi. In studies subsequent to those on the Filipino students 
I made observations in Manila (4), in Taytay (3), a town near 
Manila, and in New Orleans (5). I have demonstrated that this 
type is what I call an epitheliopath, a type which is very suscept- 
ible to diseases of the structures derived from epithelium, such as 
the lungs, alimentary canal and central nervous system. The 
hyper-onto-morph is quite distinct from the round-headed, round- 
faced type with more or less infantile nose and bowl-shaped ears. 
However, no observations were made of the ear form of the school 
children represented in this study, hence only the cephalic and 
facial indices, and the relative size of the occipital and parietal 
regions of the head can be utilized here. This will not effect a 
complete segregation of the hyper-onto-morph and the hypo-onto- 
morph, but it will indicate that a complete segregation such as 
might be accomplished by the use of the ear form and other fac- 
tors would give a more marked contrast between the two types
