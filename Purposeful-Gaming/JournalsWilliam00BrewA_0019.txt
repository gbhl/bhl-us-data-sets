1890
March 3
Enterprise, Florida
Clear, early morning frosty, warm at noon. A light
W. wind all day. Ther. fell to 31 [degrees] last night and
all the [tenderea?] plants were frost-bitten.
  Starting at 9 a.m. I crossed the Lake to
Enterprise in Mr. Breeden's little naptha launch
having a delightful sail. On reaching the
Brock House I found that Cory had gone to 
Titusville but he returned by the noon train.
I spent the forenoon rambling about in the
palmetto hamock and also visited the Bodim
place. Small birds were very numerous. In the 
orange groves Mocking Birds in full song and
Loggerhead Shrikes in pairs apparently not yet
nesting. In the hamock Yellow-rumps, Kinglets
(R. calendula), Parulas (singing), Polioptilas (singing
in their usual sotto voce way) Cardinals, and
a single [male] Hummingbird dashing about from
flower to flower of a wild orange tree chirrup-
ing loudly. I missed the Towhees, Doves and
Boat-tailed Grackles so common here last
year. There were also no Robina or Blue Jays.
Perhaps the weather, still cold for this
region, had something to do with their
absence.

  The orange trees are just coming
into bloom and were deliciously fragrant
as well as filled with multitudes of
droning bees.
  In an artificial pond fed by springs on
the Bodim place were hundreds of young
bream, beautiful little creatures of brilliant
iridescent coloring and lively actions.
