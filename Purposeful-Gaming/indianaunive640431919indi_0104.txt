CASE J. A. 2,955. This is a case of Pott's Disease in a 
little five-year-old boy who came into the hospital for treat- 
ment three years ago. He was a very sick child when he first 
came in, and his treatment was a slow process; but gradually 
his condition improved, and the accompanying picture (Illu- 
stration I) shows him in his braces from top to toe, with the 
long journey of treatment nearing its goal. The other 
photograph (Illustration II) shows the hump on the back 
Where the tuberculous condition was centered. Recent X-ray 
slides have shown that the bone condition is improving, and it 
is believed that the child will recover eventually and finally 
have a chance to be a normal boy.
