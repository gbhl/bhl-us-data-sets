288 CRUISE OF THE NEPTUNE 
In the track across Hudson bay the depth of water varies 
from fifty to two hundred fathoms, while the approach to the 
low shores of Coats and Mansfield and those of the western 
mainland is signalled by the gradual lessening of the depth of 
water, which gives ample warning to ships approaching the land. 
It will be seen from the above description that there is no 
natural difficulty in the navigation of the bay and strait so far 
as the depth of water, presence of obstructions and width of 
channel are concerned, and if situated in a more southern 
region the route would be an ideal one for the navigator. 
The western coast of Hudson bay is low and flat. It rises 
very slowly inland from swampy shores, while the water 
deepens slowly, and there are numerous shoals and bars that 
extend fOr a considerable distance from the shore-line and 
render coastwise navigation dangerous. This character of coast 
extends from the southern end of James bay to beyond the 
mouth of Churchill harbour. Further north the character of 
the coast changes somewhat, being still low, but much more 
uneven in outline, with a corresponding unevenness in the sea- 
bottom. Beyond Eskimo point, in 61 n. latitude, the straight 
shores of the southward give place to a ragged coast-line broken 
by large bays, and fringed with rocky islands having shallow 
water between them, and a broken bottom very dangerous to 
navigation. On this account, and because of the danger from 
outlying shoals and strong currents, the navigation of Chester- 
field inlet and that of the other northern bays and harbours is 
debarred from consideration. 
The mouths of all the large rivers to the southward of 
Churchill are more or less blocked by deposits of sand and clay 
brought down by the streams and deposited in the quieter waters 
at their mouths in the form of bars or flat Shoals. In conse- 
quence of these obstructions, only small craft can enter the 
harbours inside the mouths of these rivers, and larger ships are
