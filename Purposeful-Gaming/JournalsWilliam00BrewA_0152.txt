It was a beautiful afternoon but too windy for birds 
to sing well or to be heard easily. Saw only one Bobolink
and heard but one Meadow Lark. A Green Heron on Rock
Meadow rose from the roadside as we passed through the
Willows. A House Wren singing on the [Jos.?] Bird place just
beyond Mt. Auburn bridge.
