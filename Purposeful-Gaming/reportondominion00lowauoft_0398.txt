jaw, and projecting directly forward. A second horn on the 
other side of the jaw is not uncommon, but it is always shorter, 
and is often malformed or rudimentary. The horns vary in 
length up to eight feet, and are composed of a very fine quality 
of ivory. At the base the average thickness is from two to three 
inches; it tapers gradually to a point, having a spiral twist 
throughout the length. There is a large pith core at the base, 
which gradually fills after the horn has reached maturity, so 
that in old animals the horn is almost completely solid. This 
ivory is much more valuable than that obtained from the tusks 
of the walrus, being worth from $2.50 to $3 a pound. The 
ultimate destination of the ivory is China, where it is used for 
ornamental purposes as well as for medicine, and for the manu- 
facture of cups supposed to absorb all poisons placed in them. 
The flesh and skin of the narwhal are put to the same uses 
by the Eskimos as those of the White whale.
