1867
Wednesday, December 18.
  Clear and a pleasant
day. Ther. about 22 [degrees]���
26 [degrees]���10 [degrees]. Rose as
usual & barely had time
to feed Don & let him take
a run before breakfast.
Snowballed most of the
way back from school.
When I got home had some
lunch and went shooting
with Don for the first time.
Went through the Pine swamp
& also the Heron Swamp. Came
back in a "bee line" across
'the pond' which is frozen
solid. Don behaved very well
but found nothing. Saw
the same chickadee enter
the same hole as the other day.
Went up to R's in evening.

Thursday, December 19.
  Clear and a beautiful
day but very raw & windy.
Ther. about 10 [degrees]���14 [degrees]���
4 [degrees]. Rose as usual &
had barely time to exercise
and feed Don. Walked down
to school with E. Dodge &
on the way saw a flock of about
fifty robins. Rode  part of the
way home in a car & got off
by the Catholic church. Called
for Ruth & after I had had
lunch we went skating up to
'the pond' which was frozen without
an air hole. We skated across
the pond but the ice was only
smooth in Cambridge cove.
Bill carried us up to the Alm's
house Christmas tree in evening.
