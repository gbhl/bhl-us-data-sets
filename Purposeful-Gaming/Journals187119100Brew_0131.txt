from 30 to 45 ft. above the ground. Several trees
must reach a total height of fully 100 feet.
The ground beneath is dry and more or less

It contained two young, our able to fly a litter,
and two eggs.  I shot one young bird, caught
the other, and took the nest and eggs which

  On our return later in the afternoon we
saw a female Quail leading her brood of ducks

  We visited White Pond about sunset and
found the colony of ant hives somewhat
reduced in numbers. As we approached the 
pond a Cooper's Hawk shot across the narrow 
road and scaled over the broad field beyond.
