1890
March 22
Suwanee River, Florida
soon struck a new flock from which we each
got a Bachman's.
  The wind blew a gale all the afternoon
and the dead branches came down on all
sides, one striking the ground within a few
feet of me. I also heard a tree fall not
far off. 
  Just before sunset a large flock of Ardea coerulea
with a few A. ludoviciana intermixed passed
us going down river. Also saw a few Night Herons.
No Barred Owls hooting to-night.
  Red-shouldered Hawks screaming in the
woods in every direction. Their cries are much
harsher and more cracked than those of the
northern bird.
