78 cruise OF THE NEPTUNE 
concerning the passadge. To those my answere must be, that 
doubtless there is a passadge. But within this strayte, whome 
is called Hudson's straytes, I am doubtfull supposinge the con- 
trarye. But whether there be or no, I will not affirme. But 
this I will affirme, that we have not been in any tyde than that 
from Resolutyon iland, and the greatest indraft of that cometh 
from Davis' straytes; and my judgment is, if any passadge 
within resoluyton iland, it is but som creeke or inlett, but the 
maine will be up fretum Davis/ 
In accordance with this opinion, in 1616, baffin sailed up 
Davis strait, his instructions being to reach if possible the 80th 
parallel before turning westward. By following the Greenland 
coast he was able to reach Horn sound in latitude 74 before 
being greatly embarrassed by ice. Here he met a band of 
Eskimos, with whom he traded for narwhal horns and walrus 
teeth. Being liberated from Horn sound, Baffin continued 
northward past Cape Digges, in latitude 76 35', and across the 
entrance of Wolstenholme sound to Whale sound, where he was 
again beset in the ice during a gale. After being released, he 
passed Hakluyt island and reached the offilg of a great sound 
extending northWard of the 78th parallel of latitude; this he 
named after Sir Thomas Smith. This .was the northern limit 
of the voyage. He now turned south, passing cary islands, and 
on the 10th of July anchored at the mouth of Alderman Jones 
sound, where a great number of walrus were seen, but no 
natives. On the 12th Sir James Lancaster sound was dis- 
covered, but could not be entered on account of the ice across its 
mouth. Baffin could not penetrate these sounds owing to the 
strong westerly winds blowing out of them. Finding the ' mid- 
dle pack' immediately south of Lancaster sound, thickly 
jammed on the western shore, baffin stood across to the Green- 
land coast, in more Open water, and so returned home. In his 
report Baffin says that after having coasted nearly all the way 
round, he considers it nothing but a great bay, and draws
