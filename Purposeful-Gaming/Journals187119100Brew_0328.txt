1887
July 10
Concord, Massachusetts.
Alternately cloudy and clear with several heavy showers.
  With Purdie and Deane started up river at 11 A.M.,
taking both boats.
  Landed first at Martha's Point to take lunch. A
heavy thunder shower burst upon us almost immediately,
however, and lasted nearly an hour. After it passed we
continued on our way up stream going as far as the first
camp above Sherman's Bridge.
  Returning we landed a second time at Fairham and
taking a wood road walked across to the barrens where
the Hermit Thrushes are. Three males were in full song
there, none of them very good performers. A Wilson's Thrush
was also singing with them. The deerflies were so
numerous that we could not stay long.
  As we embarked again it began to sprinkle and 
we barely reached Martha's Point when a second heavy
shower forced us to seek shelter, D. & P. under one of the
sails propped against a tree, I covered with a rubber cloth
sitting in the canoe. This shower lasted over an hour.
  A third downpour overtook us at about 8 P.M.
 near the Hoar's landing driving us for refuge into a large
boat house where we sat and talked watching meanwhile
a superb display of fireflies in the meadow opposite.
 We reached the Manse at 10 P.M.
  Birds were singing rather finely to-day, especially
just after the showers. We heard Robins, Wilson's & Hermit
Thrushes, Cat. birds, Bluebirds, Yellow Warblers, Song, Swamp, 
Savanna, and Field Sparrows, Towhees, Redwings, a Tanager, etc.
Saw several Green Herons and a brood of young
Kingfishers just above Fairham.
