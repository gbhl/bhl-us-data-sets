the rest of us could get our eyes on him.
He ceased drumming after this but soon began
again and was heard at it when we left at
8 P.M. the night then being dark and cloudy.
A little after sunset a [?] Sparrow sang 
several times near us.  Swamp Sparrows were 
in full song all over the meadow and ours 
sang on wing.  Heard Night Herons and 
saw Crows flying in and out of the maple 
swamp near Buck Island. Faxon thought 
he heard a Green Heron.  He and Terry saw 
a Wood Duck fly from Pout Pond and they
passed it on the way in.
Curiously enough we heard only our Rail
the entire evening.  This bird was a Carshina 
It was calling catta at frequent intervals in
the meadow just north of the Maple Swamp
at about 8.15 P.M. as we passed on our 
way to [?] Cambridge.
