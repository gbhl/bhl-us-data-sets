  Cloudy all day. Had a
good many showers &
it misted most of P.M.
Walked down to school
with R's & was late. Came
home through the square.
Had some lunch when I got
home. Father bought me a
pair of rubber boots which
I put on & went into the
Snipe swamp, which was much
flowed on account of the rain, &
then to Pout pond. Saw about
50 redwings & rusties, a robin, &
several tit larks. The robins are
very rare now. Got back at

& spent ï¿½_ an hour with Ruth who
is getting over the effects of his poison.
Then studied at R's as usual.
The leaves are entirely off most of the
trees & the country is beginning to
look desolate.
