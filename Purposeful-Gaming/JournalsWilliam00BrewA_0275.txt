which attracted the attention of four young Loons
who came within 200 yds. cruising back and
forth and showing great curiosity.
  Late in the afternoon we rowed to Moose Pt.
On the way saw a Great Blue Heron and a 
Bonaparte's Gull. Two small flocks of Black
Ducks and a small Duck which I think
was a Whistler passed over the point as it
was getting dark but neither of us got a
shot at any of them. The Owls were not
hooting at all this evening and I heard no
Snipe or other waders.

  The Canada Jays came to the camp at
frequent intervals during the day and carried
off quantities of bread.
