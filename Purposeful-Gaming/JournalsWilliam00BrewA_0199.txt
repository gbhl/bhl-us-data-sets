Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts
Clear with thunder showers passing near the town in 
the afternoon.  In the afternoon drove to Katama & 
the south shore with C. & E.R.S.  Savanna Sparrows,
 Yellow-wings & Grass Finches singing freely on the 
plains. A few Barn Swallows followed us at times 
but most of those seen were sitting with their young 
on telegraph wires. Heard one or two Meadow Larks 
and some Towhees, Song Sparrows etc. in the scrub 
near the hotel at Katama.

Clear with light E. to S.E. wind. In the forenoon took 
a sail with C. & E.R.S. going down the bay to & into Cape 
Pogue pond, then returning and going to the head of 
the harbor. Saw about the usual number of Terns.
In one place there were fifty or more collected over 
a school of fish.
