in the middle of November
the number that I saw
was about eighteen I 
had a long chase after
them but was unable to 
procure one
  Meadow Lark
[margin]Feb 22, 1865[/margin]
  I saw 3 in a field situated
on a branch of the Fitsburgh
railroad about a quarter of
a mile from Spy Pond.
They were very shy and
I could not get one; they
are said sometimes to stay
all winter, the last time
that I saw them was
in Thanksgiving week
  Golden Winged Woodpecker
[margin]Feb 22, 1865[/margin]
  They usually stay all winter
when it is not a severe one.
I saw but one bird it was
in the same field as that
in which the Meadow Larks
were I chased him a short
distance but he was very
shy
