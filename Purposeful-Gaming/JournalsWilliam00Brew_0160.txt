ing both legs and wounding him other-
wise. He fell on the other side of the run
but when we went for him we missed
the right spot and he rose behind us
and again alighted this time in the
marsh. We went to the place but failed
to find or start him again. While look-
ing for him Lumen discovered a Pigeon Hawk 
sitting on a low stub. I fired a long shot
at him and wounded him badly. We
followed him some distance and after firing
three more shots, I killed him. In the cosmel
bushes where he fell a White-crowned Spar-
row chirped incessantly for several min-
utes but I could not see the bird. On Pine
Point a Raven was making a great racket 
calling cr-r-ruck and ow-ow by turns. All
the while the rain was pouring down in
torrents and finally we got enough of it
and returned to camp. Saw one bunch
of four and one of eight Ducks, all flying. 
They had black heads and white bellies
and were doubtless Greater Scaups. At 4
p.m. Mr. Lovejoy came in with the
steamer and made us a call. Lumen
left us when she returned. At 4.30 I
started alone for Moose Point for the
evening shooting. On the way started
a wounded bird from under the
bank. It dove and disappeared.
It was probably one of the Ducks I shot
this morning. As I neared the Point
