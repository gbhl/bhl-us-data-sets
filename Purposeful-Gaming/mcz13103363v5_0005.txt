[Calendar]
Friday, January 1, 1869.
  Morning broke cloudy
and snowing fast.
Ther. about 10[degrees] - 20[degrees] - 
14[degrees]. Rose as usual.
After breakfast went
to work on my boat
& cut the lower sculling
hole in the stern.
Then R. Deane called
and I went up to
E. Dodge's with him
and beat him at a "game
of 50". Then played with
Ed and finished up
with a game of "corporal".
Got home at about 12 N.
and found Dan here.
Spent the P.M. about
the place and in the
evening went up to
R. Deane's. By evening
about fifteen inches
of snow had fallen
& the roads were completely
blocked up.
