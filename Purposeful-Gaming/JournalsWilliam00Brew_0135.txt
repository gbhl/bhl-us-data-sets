river meadows. Skillings and Hill
flushed three birds and Skillings shot
two of them. I fired only one shot at a
Solitary Sandpiper. S. & H. broke camp
in P. M. and left on the steamer. At 4 P. M.
I started for Moose Point for the evening
shooting. Lumen heard a Duck quack
at Outlet and paddled me silently to the
spot. The bird a Black Duck rose after we
had passed her and I killed her.

At sunset I concealed myself in the
grass near the duck pond on Moose
Point and lay there over an hour. First
two Black Ducks passed wide and I
shot one barrel killing my bird at
about 60 yds. Next a pair came in setting
their wings and scaling down towards
the pond. I made a clean double on
them killing both. Afterward several
more passed out of range. Saw two
