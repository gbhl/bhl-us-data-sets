hemlock in the [delete]forest[/delete] pasture uttered a very peculiar song
which I described at length in my notes
under this species. We heard nothing either in
the swamp or on the mountain side which
we had not [delete]located[/delete] noted in this locality before.
Birds were singing rather freely late in the
afternoon. We drove home over the usual route.
