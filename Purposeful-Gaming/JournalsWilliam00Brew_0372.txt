(Sept. 12)
Outlet the past week. They have also killed many
Yellow-legs. One man got eleven by firing both barrels 
into a flock of about 300. Black Duck shooting at
Moon Point has been excellent. They offered me some 
venison from a deer which they said they killed 
yesterday on the Androscoggin.

  I then sailed past the outlet to Moon Point
where the steamer picked me up. The meadows and
mud flats seemed to be in excellent condition but
I saw no waders of any kind.

Sept. 13
Clear and warm with a strong S.E. wind all day.
  At 8.30 started for Cambridge River with C. and E.R.S.
Spelman who arrived here last night went as far as the 
Lake House with us. Just beyond the Storn farm 17 Ducks
started in two flocks, ten Wood Ducks going up nice, the 
other seven apparently Hooded Mergansers flying out over 
the Lake. On the river bank we discovered an Ereunetes 
which proved wonderfully tame. We took several photographs
of him at distances of from four to ten feet. I could
almost touch him with my oar. A single Sparrow Hawk 
scaling over the meadows near the floating island.
Many small birds about the Lake House. Three Kingfisher 
literally fighting with each other for possession of the
old elm which I am sorry to see is dying! A Bronzed 
Grackle among some starts. Red Crossbills piping.

  Started up the river at about 11.30. At the first 
larger "logan" on right started ten Wood Ducks,
all apparently in gray plumage. We afterward saw
them twice. Once they came directly over me but I was
paddling and could not get at the gun. We also started
a single Wood Duck which gave me a fine shot but again
