  Cloudy and exceedingly
cold. Ther. about 18[degrees] - 45[degrees] - 
36[degrees]. Commenced to snow
at about 6.0 A.M. and snowed

went down to Fresh pond.
Seven or eight ducks came
in during the morning
but they were all exceedingly
shy. J. Russell came home
to breakfast with me and
we started off in the wagon

I made into skins.
Eremophila Cornut, saw
a flock of about fifty and
