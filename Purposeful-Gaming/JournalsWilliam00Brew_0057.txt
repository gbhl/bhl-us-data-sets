1888
May 22
Oden, Michigan
Clear & warm. Ther. reached 75[degrees]. A. M. still. P. M. with strong S. W. to E. wind.
  The great flight of the sparrow passed to-day. When
we went down to the bath-house grove after
breakfast we found the trees there literally
swarming with Warblers and Vireos. After
shooting a number I crossed the railroad
to the swampy thickets opposite the station
and these proved to be also filled with hundreds
of birds chiefly Warblers. These numbers were
fairly confusing. I have never seen anything 
to equal it before. A list of the different
species would include almost everything that
we have thus far found here besides several
new arrivals but most numerous & conspicuous
were D. maculosa, D. caerulescens, H. peregrina
D. coronata, P. blackburnia, My. canadensis
M. pusillus, letophaga, and his olivacius.
H. rufricapilla had decreased markedly since
yesterday and I saw only a few D. palmarum.
  There were several Mourning Warblers singing
and during the day D. shot a pair of
D. tigrina.
  We spent the entire day shooting coming
in only for dinner. I did not once go
over three hundred yards from the house.
