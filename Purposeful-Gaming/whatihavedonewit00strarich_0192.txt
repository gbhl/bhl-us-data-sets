WHAT I HAVE DONE WITH BIRDS 
by rowing with the current, and after entering the river I need 
not pull; but by steering could travel quite as fast as I wanted to 
go. On that return trip my first muscalonge showed himself. 
Really, in the water it looked as long as my boat. The fish must 
have weighed fifty pounds. It was only a little way in the river 
mouth, bewildered, no doubt, by the clear water, and it turned 
almost beneath my boat and went back. A magnificent big fish it 
was. My attention was called to it by the commotion caused 
among small fish darting in all directions to escape it. 
On my way back I had a shot with a small hand-camera at a 
Heron on wing, but it was so far away that developing the plate 
disclosed only a little speck on the sky. I tried some Plover and 
a Duck with better results, but that is another story. This one is 
of the Blue Heron, and is one of my best pieces of work, quite by 
myself.
