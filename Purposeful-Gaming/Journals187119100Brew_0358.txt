Sept.16  
MAINE, (L. Umbagog.)
Clear and cool. Wind N.W., strong.
  In the forenoon [delete]visited[/delete] drove to Upton hill with
Mr. Keppler and spent about two hours searching for
Woodcock. Found one bird in the alders behind
Morse's but he rose wild, went off unshot at, and
could not be started again. In the older run
east of the road we found two Woodcock. I shot
at one of them as he rose and we did not see
him again. The other we put up seven or eight
times and after vainly trying to give Mr.K.
a sight at him I finally shot the bird.
Don made two staunch points and several
good "draws"

  In the spruces just above Frost's we saw
an immense flock of Grackles - at lest 200 birds.
They were all apparently [?] [?]. K. fired at
some of them but failed to kill any.

  In the afternoon beat the Cambridge 
River marshes thoroughly but failed to find
a Snipe or the traces of one. Don pointed a
Carolina Rail which I shot. I also bagged a
Solitary Sandpiper shooting it, sitting near
the mouth of the river The high grounds are
in excellent condition & it is strange
there are no birds on them.
