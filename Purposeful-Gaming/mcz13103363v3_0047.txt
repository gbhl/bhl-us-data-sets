Saturday, March 23, 1867.
  Cloudy all day. The snow
barely softened. Very windy.
Ther. about 30[degrees] - 38[degrees] - 32[degrees].
Went shooting in A.M.
starting at 5.30. Fired at
a crow through the
stick branches. Saw three
red & one striped squirrel,
a gull, a rabbit, several
song and tree sparrows.
Heard a snow bunting & a male
song sparrow. Got home at 8 A.M.
Saw six or seven robins in the cedar
trees. Spent A.M. in making stands,
made about 25. Then C. Carter called
& I went home with him; he let his
rabbit go & we followed it. Dan rode
down in P.M. on their horse. I
went up to the R's in the evening.
Sunday, March 24, 1867.
  Cloudy all day but did not
storm. Ther. about 34[degrees] - 46[degrees] - 34[degrees].
Went to church and sabbath
school in A.M. but was
late to the latter.
Fed my pigeons as usual when
I got home and talked
for a few minutes with
R. Deane over the fence.
In P.M. read most of
the time and H. Whitney
called for me to take a walk
with him but I did not
go. In the evening Lizzie
read to me and finished
'Tom Brew at Oxford' II.
The roads are now bare and the
walking good but the fields are
still covered with snow.
Saw a brown creeper.
