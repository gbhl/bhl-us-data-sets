1887
July 7
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and rather cool; wind W.
   During the past two days I have been engaged
in business duties to such an extent that I have had no
opportunity worth mentioning for field work.
  This morning at eleven o'clock I visited Mr. Hoar in
company with W. Deane and spent two hours watching
a Hummingbird next which contains young a few days old
The [female] came several times and fed them which operation I
observed very successfully with the help of a good glass at
about thirty feet distance.
  In the afternoon went down river to Ball's Hill with
Messrs. Hoar and Deane. The river intensely blue and very
beautiful. Sailed all the way down. A great change
since my last visit. The vegeration in its full summer
glory, the stream choked with water plants. Birds very
numerous especially Swallows and Blackbirds with young
on wing. Two broods of young Kingbirds  & met with three 
nearly hatched eggs. Birds still singing well, Pine Warbler,
Towhees, Cat-birds, Robins, Red-wings, Field Sparrows, and
Wilson's Thrushes, the last very numerous and in vigorous song.
Heard two Bobolinks one giving the song of fullest length.
Two Swamp Sparrows singing, both new arrivals; at least
I have heard none there before this season (Ball's Hill,
at the bend just above Ball's Hill a single Long-billed
Marsh Wren was in full song in the flags & canary grass 
on the left bank. I have never heard one anywhere below
Concord before. Another interesting arrival on these meadows
was a Short-billed Marsh Wren singing just above the
bayou on the right above Ball's Hill.
  We landed at Ball's Hill and had a delightful
ramble through the wood path that skirts its base
and around the back side.  New Jersey tea and dog-[?]
