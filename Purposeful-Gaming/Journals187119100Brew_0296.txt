1887
May 25
Concord, Massachusetts.
Cloudy with steady, light rain all the forenoon.
  To Ripley's Hill at 9 a.m., thence across the
"Great Fields" to the Ruffed Grouse's nest and
back by way of Caesar's Woods,
  Birds rather scarce but singing steadily and 
well as is their wont in warm rains at this
season. No migrants noted except a few
Black-polls (one [female]).
  Visited the Grouse's nest and found the
hen sitting. She allowed me to get within
about ten feet when she glided off among the
trees running silently and swiftly. Twelve eggs 
in the next; they looked discolored as if was
hatching.
  On the edge of the woods bordering the river
meadows I noticed a ragged, heart-shaped hole
in a maple stub. It looked fresh the wood 
showing clean and white within. I inserted
my forefinger which was at once sharply
pecked by the owner and plucky little Chickadee, 
who, however, came out as soon as I withdrew
the finger. I tore open the hole and found a
pretty fetted nest with six eggs, hard sat on.
  A good many Swallows on the meadow,
among them a few Martens.
  A cricket chirping in the woods and
numbers about the house in the evening. I 
have not heard them before.
  For the past three evenings a perfect Bedlam
of toads on the meadows behind the Manse.
Heard a few Hylas in the woods to-day.  Bull
frogs tromp occasionally but not often as yet.
