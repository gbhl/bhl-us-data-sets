1888
March 22
Watertown & Belmont, Massachusetts.
  Clear, with warm sun and high, cold wind.
  Took the 7:30 horse car to Mt. Auburn and spent
about two hours going over the usual ground. The cemetery
woods and French's hill yielded absolutely nothing save a
number of English Sparrows. Just beyond the cedars I
heard the first Bluebird, warbling blithely as he flitted
over the open fields. Near the Arsenal a brushy hollow
contained a small band of Titmice and three or four
Song Sparrows in full song. On the ridge beyond were
two Certhia americana both of which I shot. Hearing the
crack of a pistol at the north end of this ridge I
went to the spot and found Chadbourne in the act
of aiming at a Certhia on one of the century old white
oaks. I shot at the bird over his head he firing at
exactly the same instant. He had killed another
& we shortly found a third near the same spot.
  Crossing the railroad we proceeded through the oak
woods & thence to the main road in front of Frasar's
where George met us with the buggy. On the way
near the brook Chadbourne shot a fine [male] Loxia americana
which came flying overhead and alighted in a
low willow.
  We next drove to Belmont seeing by the way
a pair of Bluebirds, a Certhia, and adult Buteo lineatus
in an apple orchard & a large flock of Pine Linnets
feeding among some weeds. In the arsenal woods
(I forgot to mention) we saw two flocks of Rusty
Grackles, a Flicker, and heard a Blue Jay.
  Climbing the big hill by way of Prospect St. we
left the buggy at the delta and entered the cedar
woods. For some time we could find nothing
but at length heard a Crossbill piping among
