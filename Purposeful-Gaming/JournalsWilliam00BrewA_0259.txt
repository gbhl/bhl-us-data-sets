a single Golden Plover and fully 50 Pectoral Sandpipers. 
The latter were scattered about feeding making a very 
pretty, animated picture.

  I stalked the Yellow-legs and shot one sitting and 
another as it rose. The third came back past me
and also met its fate. This shooting started the Plover
and the Pectorals but they soon came back. I shot 
the Plover first as it sat on the top of a stump. 
I then killed about a dozen Pectorals. Soon after
this we heard Yellow-legs whistling up river and
paddling to the spot found three more all of which 
I killed. One was so tame that I got within two
feet of it and actually fired a shot at one of the 
others directly over its head without starting it. 
After this I heard still another Yellow-leg but we could not
find him. We also saw two flocks of Black Duck four
of which alighted but we failed to get a 
shot at them.

  Melvin met us at the mouth of the river. He had
[?] a number of Black Ducks & Sheldrake but had
had no shots.
