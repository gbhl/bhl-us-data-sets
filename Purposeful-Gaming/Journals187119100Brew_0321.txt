general commotion and came about, chirping. I watched
the [female] awhile and then gave it up. Perry, more patient,
kept him in sight for some twenty minutes afterwards &
finally saw her go into the nest which was in the very
next spruce to that containing the Flycatchers nest.
The Warbler's nest contained four perfectly fresh eggs. Perry &
Purdie got it down safely and I secured both parents.
All three of these nests were found within half an hour in
an area of only a few square rods.
  This particular spot was alive with birds, we heard here a
solitary Vireo, a Red-billed Nuthatch, a Winter Wren, a
White-throated Sparrow & several Purple Finches. Parulas

thinks D.castania summers here. Shot an ad [male] Winter Wren
and one of its young, the latter just able to fly. The
growth was chiefly of black spruces with a few maples and
patches of black ash.
  We next left the swamp and followed a path along a steep hillside
covered with tall, old beeches, red oaks, hemlocks etc. with an
undergrowth of yew. Here Bailey has found D.cairuliscius feeding.
He espied a Canada Porcupine in a tall hemlock as we were passing
beneath & climbing the tree tried to shake the animal down. It
clung to the branch however and finally crawled in

pistol. The birch trees in the vicinity were nearly all
barked by these animals and several of them had not
only the trunks, but all the branches, peeled. After
killing the Porcupine Bailey set fire to its quills so that
