1889
June 5
Cambridge, Mass.
Cloudy most of the day with two heavy showers. Warm.
  To the Fresh Pond swamps at 2 p.m., taking Denton. We
drove to the Glacialis and sent the buggy back. As we
walked up along the east bank of the Glacialis we met the
veteran frog catcher, net in hand, stepping stealthily along
the bank of Alwife Brook like a gigantic heron on the
lookout for prey. He told me he had supplied the
Parker House with frog's legs for over forty years. Formerly he
could not get enough frogs to fill his orders. Now the
market is often glutted. Frogs are sent even from Chicago.
He never kills his frogs until they are ordered. Has a cellar
full of them at all seasons. In the winter keeps a stove
running to make them comfortable.

  Crossing the Fitchburg R.R. we entered the large marsh
beyond. Faxon had reported Carolina Rails numerous here
on the 3rd and we hoped to find a nest or two but
the heavy rains of the past week have raised the
water higher than I have ever known it to be on
these marshes, at least in summer, and there was
literally not a dry spot anywhere between the railroads,
even the larger tussocks being submerged. We found one
nest that I took for a Rails but it was empty & 
water-logged. There were several Carolina Rails singing
in this marsh and beyond, possibly five being heard
in all, the last one as we were returning, on the marsh
west of the Glacialis where I found a nest and eggs
when a boy.

Several years ago a fire, one dry season, burned 
over much of the large meadow north of Glacialis and
destroyed the grass and bushes as well as eating deep
holes in the peaty ground. Over the whole of the
