number of deep bays on that side of the inlet. This plain is 
indented by all the water-courses traversing it, and in the beds 
of the principal streams broken lignite is found, evidently fallen 
from beds of that mineral in the banks above. The presence 
of lignite in these stratified deposits points to their being Ter- 
tiary in age, and corresponding with the northern areas of this 
formation already described as lying undisturbed in the wide 
valleys of the older rocks. This area in the northern part of 
baffin island is, according to the natives, quite extensive, and 
probably extends in a southwest direction to the lowlands of 
the northern and western sides of Fox channel. 
Capt. Adams, of the whaler Diana, said that lignite was to 
be found in similar deposits near Cape Hay, on the east side of 
Bylot island, and also at Durban island on the eastern coast of 
baffin island. There is little doubt that other areas of these 
Tertiary deposits occur on the Arctic islands, but owing to no 
lignite or fossils having been found in them they have not been 
separated from the drift and newer Post Tertiary deposits of 
sand, gravel and clay of these coasts. 
If Tertiary deposits were laid down on the lands of the 
Western side of Hudson bay, there is little chance of more than 
small protected areas having escaped the intense glaciation to 
which the western shores of the bay were subjected. Any such 
remaining areas are now probably hidden beneath the mantle 
of drift so universal on the low lying portions of this region. 
post TERTIARY. 
Little or no attention was given by the earlier explorers to 
the markings of ice-striae and other glacial phenomena, and the 
only records of the movement of the glacial ice noted by them 
was the distribution of erratic boulders. These observations 
have been summarized by Dawson as follows : ' Along the Arctic 
coast, and among the islands of the archipelago, there is a con-
