1889
March 14
Tallahassee, Florida.
Clear and cool with strong N.W. wind.
  Reached here on the afternoon of March 12th having
in the interim between March 4th,my last journal
record, visited Charleston and St. Augustine.
  Started at 7.30 this morning on a day's
shooting trip for Quail and Snipe taking with
me a borrowed dog, a coarse-bred liver & white
Pointer, "Bingo" by name. I also took a small
negro to drive, a boy not over eight years of age
but very efficient both as a driver and marker.
We started in a N.E. direction and drove six
or seven miles before we reached an unenclosed
country. The road led through a farming region
which closely resembles Virginia between Quantico
& Richmond very hilly and broken with deep
valleys and water courses down which flow clear
swift brooks. The soil is red clay and the
roads very hard and smooth except for the channels
worn in them by water. We passed many
large pear and apple orchards, the trees tall
and slender resembling lombardy poplars. The
pear trees and wild plums were in full blossom.
Along the roadside were many wild flowers &
the thickets were overrun by yellow jasmine.
A small tree (Pirus angustifolia) with foliage resembling a live
oak was covered with pink blossoms very
like apple blossoms. From the hill tops the
eye looked for miles over deep valleys mostly
in cotton & cornfields with scattered trees and
dark belts of pines, the latter mostly Pinus taida
I think. Live oaks hung with Tillandsia were
