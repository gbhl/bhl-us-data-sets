cord breaking crop was expected, but an unusually large 
proportion of the blossoms failed to set fruit. 
It was mostly the under berries that failed to de- 
velop, for the crop as a whole is more on top than usual. 
Almost no berries are commonly found in thick clumps 
of vines, Where the bossoms were abundant, while in thin 
vines nearby there is a fair amount of fruit. 
These conditions are general, though less so on the 
bogs that either had no winter-flowage or had it taken 
off early. The rainy weather during the blossoming 
period evidently caused this failure of the set, though it 
is hard to say how it did so. The rain may have pre- 
vented a proper fertilization of the blossoms, either by 
washing off the pollen or by preventing bees from work- 
ing actively. Perhaps the blossoms were blasted by an 
unusual prevalence of fungous diseases induced by the 
excessive moisture. 
I venture the opinion that late holding of the winter 
flowage so throws the blossoming period out of its nor- 
mal season that the danger of its meeting unfavorable 
conditions for the setting of the fruit is usually consider- 
ably increased thereby. 
That the flooding of a bog when the berries are very 
small is dangerous was shown by the effects observed on 
bogs flowed by freshets caused by the excessive rain- 
fall which culminated in the great precipitation of July 
24, when it was estimated that over 1000 acres of the 
Cape bogs, either in or only a little past their blooming 
period, were under water. Some bogs, with the blossom- 
ing period past and crop fully set, that were submerged 
for not over 15 hours, lost half their berries in spite of 
the cloudy weather that prevailed when the water was 
let off and for three days afterward. The largest of the 
berries injured under these circumstances were somewhat 
over a quarter of an inch in diameter. A considerable per- 
centage of the larger berries on some bogs, however, en, 
dured submergence for two or three days Without ap- 
parent injury.
