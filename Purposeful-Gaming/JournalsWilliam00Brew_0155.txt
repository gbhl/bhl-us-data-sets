Oct. 5. 
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Cloudy with steady rain all the forenoon
P.M. misty. Lake nearly calm. Spent
morning at camp working on birds. after
dinner paddled over the Outlet mead-
ows but saw nothing. Thence to Pine
Point. Passing a rocky shore we started
startled a grouse. Landing and hunting throu-
gh the woods over a few acres we started
no less than five. I shot two, one sitting
on a log, another on a maple. and
missed a fair shot at a third which
flew from a fallen top. There was a large
flock Titmice.Nuthatches etc. in these
woods. Returning to the shore we saw 
a fine ad. [male] Sheldrake fly past out of
range. Shortly afterwards a Black Duck
passed and turned into a cove to the east-
ward. Heard Ducks splashing among the 
grass at the head of the cove. Finally three
Black Ducks saw us and rose going off di-
rectly into the woods. The next moment
two others rose and came down past us 
within 30 yds. I caught them as they
drew together and killed both with
one barrel. Thence to Moose Point. First
a single Duck passed out of range
then four. Finally a single Black
Duck circled around and turned
back over me. I killed her as she
was going off. The evening was per-
fectly still and I could hear a Duck's
