1887
(July 15)
a young bird startled. All thru which a [male] was singing
on a rue stalk near by. I walked up to him and shot
him. He was in fine plumage as were both [?] Marsh Wrens.
All three of [?] birds had the testes of enormous [?] and
the sexual glands (?) about the anus swollen and turgid.
It is evident that both species are now breeding a second
time this season.
  I heard two other Henslow's Sparrows singing here, one
beyond the island to the S.W., the other in the meadow
through which I passed on the way to my boat. I shot
the [?] but could not find him.
  Just below the mouth of Pantry Brook along the
banks of the concord I heard on my way up two
Long-billed Marsh Wrens. On my way down I heard
no less than five singing, scattered along for half-a-mile
or more, all in canary grass. There were none here
last year and none early this season. They must
be working down river from the Sudbury Marshes.
  Had a delightful paddle and sail home. The
wind had died to a gentle breeze and the air was
cool and bracing. Birds sang freely at sunset.  I
heard three Tanagers, an Oven-bird, Red-eyes, Robins,
Towhees, a Field Sparrow, Chewink, two Grass Finches
and an unprecedented number of Long Sparrows (at least
fifty). Also heard swamp Sparrows in the usual
places. A Night-hawk squeaking over Martha's Point.
  On the way up saw an Accipter fuscus at [?]
Bridge. It started out in pursuit of a Kingbird
but soon abandoned the chase.
  The first Cicada yesterday.
