were nearly two feet in diameter. Woodard told
us that both porcupines and white hares were
numerous in these woods. I saw many orange
colored Salamanders similar to those which are
so numerous on Mount Greylock. Of birds, the
characteristic species inhabiting this forest
were Ruffled Grouse, Pille[delete]i[/delete]ated Woodpeckers, Winter
Wren, Blackburnian Warblers, Black Throated Green
Warblers, Golden Crested Kinglets, Hermit Thrushes,
Snow Birds, and Oven Birds. Of the Pilliated 
Woodpecker we saw no birds, but their recent
presence was attested by their numerous char-
acteristic mortise-shaped holes in the trunks
of the dead stubs. Some of these holes had been
made so recently that the wood was quite
new and fresh. There seemed to be only
one Winter Wren on the mountain, or at least
only one male. I heard him sing twice, once
rather indistinctly, in [delete]the[/delete] ravine; the second
time near at hand and very loudly. The
Blackburnian Warblers were exceedingly num-
erous, almost so much so in fact as
the Black Throated Greens. Both were in full
song, and Kinglets also abundant [delete]and[/delete] were singing
freely. We heard a single White Throated Sparrow,
probably the same bird noted yesterday.
  After Faxon met me we returned to
the spruce pasture where we spent half an
hour or more. These pastures are covered
with black spruce, and balsams (the latter
nowhere common) trees from ten to twenty feet
high, growing thickly with little openings
