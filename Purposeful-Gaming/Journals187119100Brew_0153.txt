was a Marsh Wren (C. stellaris) singing at the inlet.
  Returning to the Cliffs we climbed there
and descended into the woods at the eastern
side in hopes of hearing the Hermit Thrushes. (The 
wind was blowing so strong that we could
hear nothing from the Cliffs). After walking 
nearly 1/4 of a mile along a wood path we
came out on a huckleberry barren with scattered
clumps of scrub oaks and found through Thrushes
in full son within an area of a few hundred
yards. It was a glorious concert and we 
lingered long listening.
  There we reached the river it was only
dark with a fresh S.W. wind blowing before
while we sailed most of the way to towers
reaching home at 10 P.M.
  At the Cliffs Landing two tree Crickets
were in full long. I think we heard one
of them getting his strings in tune on our last 
visit.
  At sunset hundreds of Swallows were
passing all flying up river and hence in
a generally southern direction.
  At the Cliffs landing we saw a Turtle
Dove, doubters the same bird observed them
as nearly every previous visit.
  Mountain holly (Nemopanthes) abundant
in the bog about Kaluna glauca swamp.
  No Warblers migrating this evening.
