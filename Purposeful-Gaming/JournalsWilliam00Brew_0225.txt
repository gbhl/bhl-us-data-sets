1889
Feb. 11
Enterprise, Florida.
Clear and warm.
  Spent the morning about the house taking a
walk in the palmetto hammock. Birds very numerous
there, Cardinals, White-throated Sparrows Ruby-crowned
Kinglets, a Blue Gray Gnatcatcher, a Cat Bird, a Brown
Thrasher, a Yellow-throated Warbler. Nothing singing except
the Gnatcatcher. A large flock of Fish Crows feeding on
palmetto berries. Ground Doves in the orange grove.
  Hunted Quail in p.m. going out alone on the
road to Orange City. "Nelly" found two bevies, one
by the roadside in pine woods, the other on the
edge of a swampy thicket. At the first I fired
both barrels at long range bringing feathers from
one bird but stopping neither. I then got in a
single fresh shell just in time to bring down a
laggard that rose after the others. These Quail took
to dense scrub when "Nelly" put up several, only one
of which I shot at and missed (at about 70 yds).
  The pointer put up a single bird of the second
bevy which I shot. She then stood handsomely on
the main bevy. I made a double as they rose
shooting one and turning quite around to catch
the other. Some six or eight got off but I
found only one which I shot over a steady
point in palmetto scrub.
  "Nelly" roaded another bevy near the Orange City
field but failed to find it. In this field a
large flock of Meadow Larks alighted among
broom grass at sunset evidently to roost. They
came in from, a distance in a compact flock
like blackbirds.
