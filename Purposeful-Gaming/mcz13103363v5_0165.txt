After breakfast went
out to the farm.
Took Dend. Striata [male]:

In P.M. went down
to the pond and pulling
across went through to

shots at a Red Tailed Hawk.
In the evening went
down to a tea party at
the Nichol's but talked
most of the time with C.
Carter as I knew none of the
girls.

Rose as usual.
Spent the forenoon in
the house, writing most
of the time. In the
afternoon the rain
held up and I went
down to the pond.
Sailed the length of the
pond in my boat but
saw nothing.
  Got home at 6 P.M.
The weather was so
extremely warm that
we were obliged to throw
open all the doors to
cool the house off.
Bernicla Canadensis,
saw a large flock mi-
grating Southwards.
