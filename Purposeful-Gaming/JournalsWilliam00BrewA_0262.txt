1890
Oct. 8
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Cloudy with no wind. Damp snow fell steadily all the forenoon
covering the ground to a depth of two or three inches &
loading the branches of the evergreens. The brilliant 
autumn foliage showed to great advantage in contrast 
with the snow and evergreens.

  We left camp at about 8 A.M. and paddled over to the
mouth of the river where we found a pair of Black
Ducks and a flock of seven near them. Will Sargent
paddled M. to within about 70 yds. of the pair when
they flew & alighted with the others which proved too
shy to approach.

  Jim and I kept on down the river and just above
Leonard's Pond saw a Wood Duck swimming across.
It went in behind a stump from which it peeped 
out at us at intervals. When we were within 20 yds.
it rose and I shot it.

  We next went into Leonard's Pond while M. rowed over
to Moose Pt. We found a flock of eight Sheldrake in the
pond and running the boat in under the bank at
the upper end of the island waited for them to work
up to us. They came rapidly and were soon in the
gut. One saw us before I could get them bunched
& I had to shoot. I killed one & wounded another
with my first barrel and wounded a third with my
second barrel. Both wounded birds dripped in the
pond but both flew out before we got near enough
to shoot them [?].

  While in pursuit of the second Sheldrake we started
two large flocks of Wilson's Snipe from the edge of
the water. There were fully 30 birds in one flock
and ten or twelve in the other. They flew in
