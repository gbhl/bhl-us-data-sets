28 CRUISE OF THE NEPTUNE 
They received little pay beyond their food, which consisted 
chiefly of the Scraps left from the meals. 
Dr. Faribault had shown signs of mild insanity, almost from 
the time of leaving Halifax. On the 1st of November he 
became violently insane, when, on the advice of Dr. Borden, 
he was placed in charge of the police as a dangerous lunatic. 
The poor man had to be confined in a cell, and watched con-

was happily released by death on the 27th of april following. 
As soon as the ice became sufficiently thick to bear the load, 
a wall of snow about three feet thick was erected around the 
ship, and raised to the top of the temporary decking. Sails, 
spread on the roof, were covered with about a foot of snow. By 
these means all draughts were effectually kept out of the ship, 
and the temperature of the interior was raised several degrees. 
Holes were cut in the banking to allow light to enter the ports 
and windows, and snow porches were erected over the exits on 
each side; the deep holes at the ports resembled embrasures, 
and the general appearance of the ship was that of a floating 
fort.

the ordinary work about the ship was hardly enough to keep the 
crew in health, and all were encouraged to hunt or attend lines 
of fox-traps for exercise. This proved much better than formal 
exercise at stated times, and the general health remained good 
throughout this long period of enforced idleness. 
Only two meals were cooked daily during the short days of 
mid-winter, breakfast being at ten and dinner at four, an in- 
formal Supper being provided in the evening. 
Games and cards were provided for the use of all; musical 
instruments, including a piano, were in frequent use, while a 
weekly lecture, dance and newspaper went far to agreeably 
pass away the long winter evenings, which were further relieved
