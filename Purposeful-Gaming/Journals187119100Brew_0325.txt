so thickly that it was difficult to penetrate between
them in many places.  The ground beneath was
carpeted with moss and usually free from under-
growth. This swamp was precisely similar to
the evergreen swamps of N. Main save for the
absence, already mentioned of the arbor vitae.
  The white hare and Canada porcupine are both
abundant in this region. There are  no du[?] or bears
but a "wild cat" is occasionally seen. Red squirrels
are abundant, gray squirrels less so but still common.
The mountain butterfly with broad white wing bars on
a steel blue ground is common everywhere and I
noticed several other mountain or northern species.
  The bird fauna is most interesting for it combines
many of the characteristic Canadian and Alleghanian
forms. Thus the Brown Thrasher, the Towhees & the Cat-bird
are all common; the Meadow Lark, Baltimore Oriole,
Bobolink, Carolina Dove & Yellow Warbler found sparingly
but regularly; which mingled with them are the Hermit
Thrush, Blackburnian Warbler, Parula, Canada Flycatcher & Solitary Vireo in great
abundance; the [?], Yellow-rump & Black and Yellow
Warbler, the Golden-crested Kinglet, Canada Nuthatch, Winter
Wren, White-throated Sparrow, Olive-sided Flycatcher not 
uncommon; and (according to Bailey) the Bay-Breasted
Warbler rare. Apparently absent are the Yellow-throated Vireo, 
Warbling Vireo and Pine Warbler. Bailey has never found the Rose breasted
Grosbeak but I heard one [male].  Henslow's Sparrow is
abundant in the meadows according to Bailey.  Loons
breed regularly on a large pond in the town. The Purple Finch
and Black-throated Wren Warbler are exceptionally abundant
throughout the evergreen woods. Indigo Birds are much more
numerous than in Middlebury Co. Acadian Owls are common,
Screech Owls rare.
