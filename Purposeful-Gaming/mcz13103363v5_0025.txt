Tuesday, February 9, 1869.
  Clear and warm.
Ther. about 30[degrees]¬ù - 40[degrees] - 
35[degrees]. Rose as usual
and began school
again to day.
  Walked down with
the boys but did
not write any
lessons. In P.M.
had Tiger harnessed
and took a sleigh
ride first down as
far as the High School
and then up through
Waverley. They
sleighing was very
poor as the ground
was bare in many
places. In the evening
called to see J. Nichols
and spent the evening
with him.
Wednesday, February 10, 1869.
  Cloudy but warm.
Ther. about 30[degrees] - 40[degrees] - 
35[degrees]. Rose as usual
and attended school
in A.M. Recited
everything except
Greek which my eyes
are still too weak for.
Got out at recess and
set to work on my
lessons as soon as I got
home. Studied most
of the P.M. and read
over 300 lines of Virgil
that I had lost by
my sickness. Then
took a hoseback ride
around and across
Fresh pond passing
across the other side
on the ice. In the evening
went up to the Deane's and
Walter showed me the
'redou' step.
