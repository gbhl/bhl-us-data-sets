1886
Oct. 4
Concord, Massachusetts.
  A five day, clear, warm, with light S. W. wind.
  To Estabrook woods with Henshaw at 8 a.m.
Went over my usual ground or rather a portion
of it for birds were so numerous that we did not 
get ahead at all fast.  One of the heaviest flights
of the season must have come down from the 
north last night for the country was literally
swarming with Thrushes (chiefly T. Swainsomi with 
a few T. aliciai, biunelli and pollasi) Yellow-Swamps,
White-Throated Sparrows, Towhees, Robins, etc.
  In the swampy wood lot where the Migiarchus was 
found last June were numerous flocks of Cedar birds
feeding on black alder berries.  There were also Thrushes, one
the Thickets, many Purple Finches in the wild apple
trees (the male is in full plumage and singing freely but 
in hardened tones), surreal Downy Woodpeckers, a Catbird
or two, a Nutchatch (S. carolinensis) and quantities of
Robbins. Altogether the place was fairly turning with 
bird life.
  The oak woods beyond offered little more attraction
than a small flock of Zitanica and Yellow-rumps
among which I detected and shot a Sitta canadensis
and a Regulus satrapa.  The deep pine forest still
further on held only a few Thrushes and two more
Kinglets but in the birches outside we found a 
rather larger mixed flock containing about 20 
D. striata, as many now D. coronata, a small
flock of Pine Linnets and several Purple Finches,
besides a Winter Wren which I wounded but lost.
Henshaw also shot an Oporouis agalis hen.
  Returning to the road I walked back to them
