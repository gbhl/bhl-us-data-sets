POMOLOGY 
a comparatively small number of varieties could be 
grouped about it. But this is only one of the Several 
apparently authentic groups which might be erected 
upon certain characteristics of tree. In addition to 
Astrachan we might cite (1) Hibernal type: trees vigor- 
ous growers, with open spreading tops, and very large, 
leathery leaves. (2) oldenburg type: moderate growers, 
with compact, round-topped heads; ivs. of medium size. 
(3) Longfield type: slow growers; branches horizontal 
or pendulous; ivs. whitish and woolly underneath. 
The Longfield apple, now one of the most popular of 
the Russians, is shown in Fig. 1902. (4) Transparent 
and tetofsky type: trees pyramidal; bark yellow, with 
numerous spurs; ivs. large, light green. (5) Anis type: 
trees upright, spreading or vase-shaped; ivs. medium, 
veins reddish. It would seem reasonable to suppose 
that the Anis family was derived from the Astrachan 
type. The flesh of the fruit of the various types is very 
similar. 
These represent the principal types of Russian 
apples. The fruit they bear in this climate matures in 
the summer, autumn or early winter. It does not ap- 
pear that any of the especially hardy varieties of un-_ 
doubted north or east Russia origin are winter kinds 
when grown in the Mississippi valley. Such late-keep- 
ing kinds as give promise of commercial value appear 
to have originated in the Baltic provinces or to have 
been transported at an early date from the countries to 
the west. These types-the Synaps for instance-have 
characteristically small leaves, slender twigs, and are 
less hardy than members of the groups cited above. 
The "bloom," or glaucous covering, of the Russian 
apple is characteristic. It does not persist to the same 
extent, however, under all climatic conditions. In east- 
ern Quebec it fails to develop to the same extent that it 
does under the drier atmospheric conditions of the east- 
ern states. As additional proof that this pruinose bloom 
is an immediate climatic effect, we have but to com- 
pare the Colorado Spy with that grown in New York. 
The smooth, thin skin and abundant bloom of the colo- 
rado apple is characteristic in a greater or less degree 
of all varieties produced in the dry regions adjacent 
to the Rockies, as it is of the Russian apples in the 
more arid portions of that country. 
The names of Russian apples are much confused. 
There is no pomological society in Russia to assist the 
fruit-grower in eliminating synonyms; on the other 
hand, the factors conducive to confusion are strongly in 
evidence. These are illiteracy on the part of the grower 
and the practice of propagating fruit trees from the 
seed instead of by grafting. Gibb says "nomenclature 
in Russia is hopelessly confused. different names are 
given to the same apples in different localities, the 
same name to different apples growing in adjacent 
districts." 
Fruit-growers of the West, realizing that Americans 
should have a uniform system, at least in the nomen- 
clature of these varieties, called a meeting made up of 
interested representatives of the fruit-grower's asso- 
ciations of South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa and Wis- 
consin. These delegates, collectively styled the "Rus- 
sian Apple Nomenclature Commission," met at La 
Crosse, Wis., Aug. 30-31, 1898. They decided that it 
would be wise to attempt a grouping to be based upon 
"family resemblance." In accordance with this the fol- 
lowing statement was adopted: "The varieties here 
grouped as members of the same families, while in a 
few cases differing somewhat in characteristics of tree, 
are so nearly identical in fruit that for exhibition and 
commercial purposes they are practically the same and 
should be so considered." It is to be regretted that a 
commission on nomenclature should take such a radical 
stand as this, because the characteristics of a variety 
cannot be changed by voting to call it by the same name 
as the other member of the group which it most 
resembles and almost, though not quite, duplicates. 
The trend of modern pomology is to preserve small 
differences, to differentiate rather than blend. The work 
of the future will consist in large part in studying 
small differences with a view of finding closer adapta- 
tions. The propriety of ignoring Russian nomenclature 
and the rule of priority is questionable, but in a 
measure is defensible on the grounds of a confused 
Russian nomenclature and the unpronounceableness of 
Russian names. The findings of the committee have on 
the whole met with the approval of those interested in 
Russian apples.

cherries.-these, next to the apples, constitute the 
most clearly defined group of Russian fruits; yet many 
cherries commonly called Russian are in reality Polish, 
silesian or German. The typical cherry of northern Rus- 
sia is represented by the Vladimir type. Fig. 1903. This 
was first introduced into America as a distinct variety. 
Later importations and experience demonstrated that 
Vladimir was a type, not a variety. This type appears 
to have been grown in Russia for centuries from seed 
and sprouts. In this way a special class has been de- 
veloped. The Vladimir type is characterized by its 
dwarf stature-5-8 feet high-its peculiarly rounded 
and compact top, its dark red, meaty-fleshed fruit. 
Koslov-morello is evidently a light-colored juicy variety 
of Vladimir. The characteristics of the tree are the 
same as Vladimir, although when grown from seed in 
this country the seedlings exhibit considerable va
