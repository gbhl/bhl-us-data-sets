1887
May 22
Concord, Massachusetts.
Clear and warm. Wind South.
  To Ripley's Hill at 9 A.M. Upon reaching 
the edge of he pines I saw a [female] Pine Warbler
fly to the neighboring orchard. Suspecting her
errand I waited until she returned when
as I expected she had her bill full of some
downy substance. After a few short flights among
the pines she entered her nest which was
evidently nearly finished. The [male] was singing
steadily in the next tree.
[margin]Nest of 
Pine Warblers[/margin]
  These pines were literally alive with D. Striata,
all [male]s, and nearly all singing. I detected
among them a [female] D. castanea  and shot
her.
  In the thickets on the eastern slope of
the hill I found two D. maculosa, both [female]s,
and a number of common summer residents.
Started a pair of Turtle Doves from the
white pine on this slope. Also started from
a birch a Pigeon Hawk. I could not be
mistaken for he flew off over the valley in
plain sight quivering his wings in the
characteristic Falcon way.
  Found a nest of Spizella socialis with
two eggs.
  Spent the remainder of the day in 
the house.
  Saw distinctly a Gray-cheeked Thrush in
the willows by the old boat house.
