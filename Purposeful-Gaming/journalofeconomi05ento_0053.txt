February, '12] ENTOMOLOGISTS' PROCEEDINGS 27 
tion in adding to the Board of Directors. I wish to make a motion 
in this form, that "the above officers, together with the chairman of 
the Advisory Committee, shall constitute the Board of Directors," 
if we adopt this Board of Directors rather than Executive Committee. 
I think there is very little difference. I think an Executive Com- 
mittee will legally be considered as having the same status as a Board 
of Directors. I merely present this as my opinion, as a desirable thing 
to do. 
PRESIDENT F. L. WASHBURN: You move that as an amendment 
to the original motion, which was to adopt the report? 
A. D. HOPKINS: Yes. 
PRESIDENT F. L. WASHBURN: Any second to that? 
E. D. SANDERSON: I will second that, to get it before the house. 
I would like to ask a question, and that is, are the duties of this Advis- 
ory Committee defined in any place in the constitution? 
E. P. FELT: The duties of the Advisory Committee, I think, are 
defined in the report of the committee made to the Association. It 
states how they shall be elected, and that they shall nominate the 
officers of the JOURNAL. 
E. D. Sanderson : The Advisory Board has acted as such on general 
matters of policy and on matters of business policy, for instance, 
the consideration of advertising has been referred to that Board, 
and I think it highly desirable that we have a Board of this kind, 
and, without any criticism of the management of the JOURNAL, 
which would hardly be in order, I do believe that we should have a 
Board who would take a little more active interest in the policy of the 
JOURNAL, and I think we ought to continue the members of that Board 
from year to year, having one man as chairman, and having him, in 
addition to the Editor and the Business Manager, as a Director. I 
think that such a policy obtains in some other associations. 
HERBERT Osborn : I would like to suggest that Professor Sanderson 
may not know how much interest the committee has taken and how 
closely we have watched the things that appeared in the JOURNAL, and 
how quick to detect if it were going astray. (Laughter.) 
E. D. SANDERSON: Mr. President, I haven't been in a position 
to judge of that, but I didn't mean that as a criticism of the Advisory 
Board at all, but merely that we do want the benefit of judicious 
criticism. 
PRESIDENT F. L. WASHBURN: There is a motion before the house 
in the form of an amendment, which almost takes the form of a 
minority report, Dr. Hopkins, because I notice you were on the com- 
mittee for which Mr. O'Kane reported.
