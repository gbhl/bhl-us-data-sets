1889
June 3
Wellesley Hills, Mass.
Cloudy and still all day with a dash of rain late in the p.m.
  To Grantville (= Wellesley Hills) by 8 a.m. train meeting
Denton at the station. As there was no depot carriage there
we started on foot striking up over Mangus Hill by a
old road that wound about through the oak & chestnut woods
and finally emerged, or rather ended, in a valley at this
base of this hill on the back side. This valley proved to be the
scene of my Grouse shooting last autumn & hence was familiar
ground. In it we spent most of the day searching for
nests.
  Our first find was a Wood Pewee's building in a chestnut
on the hill. The second a chestnut-sided Warbler's with two
fresh eggs, hazel along a wall. The third a Chestnut-sided
with five eggs on the point of hatching, this also in hazel.
The fourth a Nashville Warbler's with five young about half - grown.
(details of position etc in my systematic notes); the bird fluttered
out under my feet but was seen first by Denton. The fifth a
Maryland Yellow-throat's, building. The sixth, a Cat birds with one egg.
The seventh, a Field sparrow's, with four eggs nearly hatched,  built most
prettily in a cluster of cinnamon ferns on the edge of the bushy
swamp. The eighth a Solitary Vireo's in an oak on the south side of
Mangus Hill, in open maple & oak woods. (To my great surprise this
nest held 4 young nearly large enough to fly and well feathered).
The Ninth a Crow's in the fork of a chestnut on the north side
of the hill. Denton climbed the tree and brought down three
eggs much incubated. Beside this we found two Wood Thrushes'
nests, both empty, one evidently robbed.
  Birds were very numerous in this valley. I heard two
Wood Thrushes, a Meadow Lark, a Bobolink, three Grass Finches,
four Grosbeaks, two Tanagers, three Golden-winged Warblers,
