wintering IN THE BAY 31 
confined to the superintendence of the surveys, and to such 
geological work as could be accomplished within a day's journey 
of the ship. 
On the 4th of May, accompanied by two Eskimos, I left for 
an exploratory trip along the coast to the mouth of Chesterfield 
inlet, in order to connect the work of Caldwell with that of 
Tyrrell. This work was accomplished in ten days, during part 
of which we were confined to our tent, and almost buried by the 
heaviest snowstorm of the year. A sketch survey was carried to 
the mouth of the inlet, and all rock exposures on the way were 
examined. The rocks met with were chiefly granite, with 
masses of dark schists inclosed in the granite areas. Some of 
the schists were cut by quartz veins, which carried small quan- 
tities of pyrite, but nowhere sufficiently concentrated to be of 
value. The most promising locality seen was on the islands a 
few miles to the westward of Fullerton, where the veins were 
numerous, and where the natives report some veins well 
mineralized. 
On the return journey the country about Winchester inlet 
was examined inland for a distance of forty miles. A descrip- 
tion of its physical character has already been given. 
Mr. Caldwell arrived back safely on the 30th of May. The 
first rain fell on the 21st, after which the weather gradually 
lost its wintry character, and although by no means warm, was 
sufficiently moderate to allow the surveying work to go on with- 
out much discomfort. 
From the first week in June all hands were busy removing 
the winter coverings, and getting the ship in order for the 
coming summer. 
WHALEBOAT TRIP TO SOUTHAMPTON ISLAND. 
Captain Comer had kindly invited me to accompany his 
boats on a whaling trip to Southampton island, and for this 
purpose had lent me two boats fitted with covers for the trip.
