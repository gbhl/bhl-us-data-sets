oxygen is taken up slowly from the air. The oxygen 
content of the unshaded tubs, both in Spectacle Pond 
and in the ditch, showed considerable variation be- 
tween the day and night periods. The variation be- 
tween day and night was very uniform throughout the 
experiment, the oxygen content of the water in the un- 
shaded tubs in Spectacle Pond running slightly higher 
than in the unshaded tub in the ditch throughout. The 
water in Spectacle Pond showed very little variation 
from day to day or between day and night at any time 
during the experiment. Only on two occasions was a 
considerable change in the oxygen content of the pond 
water observed. One of these Was at five o'clock on 
' the morning of June 30th, the other at nine o'clock on 
July 2nd. The decreases in the oxygen content of the 
water at these times is due to the fact that the water 
samples were taken too close to the outlet ditch from 
the State Bog so that the sample contained a consider- 
able portion of bog water mixed with the pond water. 
As the bog water is considerably lower in oxygen con- 
tent the natural result of mixing bog water with the 
pond water is to reduce the oxygen content of the lat- 
ter. The ditch water also showed a wide variation be- 
tween day and night in this experiment. This is due 
to the presence of algae in the water as these plants 
during the day were actively giving off oxygen and 
during the night were using up oxygen in their respir- 
atory processes. The lack of vegetation in Spectacle 
Pond accounts for the uniformity of the oxygen content 
between day and night, the slight changes occurring 
in Spectacle Pond being due mostly to the difference 
in temperature. 
From this experiment it is evident that injury oc- 
curred only on the plants in the shaded tubs. The 
shaded tubs both in Spectacle Pond water and in ditch 
water show a great reduction below the normal oxygen 
content of either ditch water or pond water. As the 
oxygen content of the water was the only factor which 
underwent material change the injury must be at- 
tributed to the absence of oxygen. Very little differ- 
ence was noted between the degree of injury of shaded 
plants in ditch water as compared with shaded plants 
in pond water which indicates that nothing in the qual- 
ity of the water aside from lack of oxygen caused the 
injury. The plants that were submerged but not shad- 
ed suffered little or no injury. Analyses of the water,
