tangled vines beneath. Again I felt it was my
illusion Prothonotary. I then chirped once or twice
and waited. Presently there was a flash of wings
and a small bird rose into the maple directly in 
front of me. The leaves concealed it for a moment
there it hopped out into full view and the long-
sought proven was before me. I shot and it dashed
off like an arrow then turned about alighted again
still within good range when  a second shot killed
it instantly. Where I reached the shot where it
fell I formed it lying on a rock among the ivy
leaves which formed a fitting setting for the 
beautiful golden breast turned upward. It
proved, as I had supposed, a female in full autumnal
plumage. With it, or at least in the barn
thicket, were two Creepers (Mniotilta) and
a Maryland Yellow-Throat. It was about 20 ft
above the ground when I fired the first 
shot.

  I saw perhaps 20 Barn Swallows and
a few Kingbirds. At the Luzania bed then
were not over 50 Red-wings. The water 
Thrushes were nearly all gone to-day. In 
fact I saw only one and in my search
I unpacked all the thickets thoroughly.
  The migrations are now flowing steadily
and strongly. As I write (10 P.M.) I hear the 
lisping of passing Warblers and every now and then
the startling call of a Bicknell's Thrush (heard
to night for the first time this Summer).
