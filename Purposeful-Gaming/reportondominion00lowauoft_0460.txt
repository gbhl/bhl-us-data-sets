(k)-in a slab of yellow weathering dolomite: 
1. camarotoechia ekwanensis, Whiteaves. 
2. Smooth and small Glassia-like brachiopod, too imperfect for 
identification. 
3. Obscure remains of a trilobite, indeterminable. 
(l)-in a drab-coloured limestone: 
1. Pentamerus oblongus, Sowerby. These forms resemble closely 
those determined by the writer in Dr. Bell's collections 
from Mansfield island.

BRACHIOPODA. 
1. strophomena, sp., of the type of S. hecuba, Billings. 
- 2. (Rafinesquina) alternata, (Emmons) Conrad. This 
limestone appears to be homotaxial with the Trenton of 
Ontario and the Galena-Trenton of the Manitoba region. 
(n)-in a yellow weathering dolomitic limestone: 
BRACHIOPODA. 
1. Strophomena, sp., or strophomenoid shell with alternata-type of 
sculpture. 
2. camarotoechia, sp., cf. c. ekwanensis, Whiteaves. 
3. Glassia?, sp. indt. 
OSTRACODA. 
4. Leperditia, sp., cf. Leperditia hisingeri, Schmidt. 
5. Primitia, sp. indt. 
(0)-in a drab coloured dolomitic limestone: 
cephalopoda. 
1. A portion of some gyroceran or orthoceratite shell; resembles in 
some respects the external characters of Orthoceras nicolleti 
figured in Vol. iii., part 11, of the Palaeontology of Minnesota, 
pl. 55, fig. 1.
