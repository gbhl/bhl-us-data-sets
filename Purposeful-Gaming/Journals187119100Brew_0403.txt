Lake Umbagog, Maine

marsh, but flushed only one Snipe which Melvin shot. Steve 
Morse came along and reported the Lake full of Ducks. We
started out at once, but stopped to stalk two Black Ducks 
opposite the Stone farm. They swam beyond a slough and Mel-
vin then tried them in a boat, actually paddling within 
fifty yards without cover and killing one. 
  Next to B Point. The wind was moderating fast. 
Two bunches of Scoters off Great Island. Rowed out and 
around them. They were very shy, but each bunch gave us a 
long flying shot and we killed two birds from each, the first 
two O. americana, the last two P. perspicillata. Probably 
each bunch was homogeneous. All went out at dusk, flying 
restlessly from place to place, finally rising high in the 
air.

nothing more seen until reaching the Narrows where I was
paddled to a flock of four Horned Grebes. Shot two sitting
a third as it rose. At the entrance to Black Island Cove 
saw fifteen Whistlers near shore. Landed, but they flew.
Melvin next stalked five Whistlers and four Sheldrake. He 
go very near them, but two Black Ducks alighted and he waited
for them, finally getting a fair shot, but missing. Lunched 
here; thence to the outlet. Four Tringa bonapartii and an
