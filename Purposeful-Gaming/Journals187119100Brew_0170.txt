1886
Aug. 14
  Cloudy most of the day with occasional interwoven
of sunshine and a heavy thunder shower about noon.
Hot and sultry. There 85 degrees at noon. 
  Spent the day on the river starting at 10 A.M.
and going as far as the great woods below
Ball's Hill.

  I sailed most of the way down stopping often
and landing several times. Birds were numerous
and several species singing rather steadily. I
heard as many as three or four Song Sparrows and 
about the same number of Maryland Yellow-throats.
Also our Oriole and one Indigo.
  Water Thrushes were abundant for the first 
time this Summer. I saw and heard at least
12 and shot six.

  Landed at Ball's Hill and took lunch under the 
oak on the river bank. A small flock of Chickadees
with a few Warblers accompanying them came about me.
I shot two D. pennsylvanica and a Vireo flavifrons.
Two Wood Peewees singing on the back side of the hill.
  Each report of my pistol brought a perfect chorus
of Rail voices from the Wild river along the banks.
The meadows having been cut the Rails are now
all concentrated along the river.
  From Ball's Hill I sailed down to the great
wood when I got the Long-eared Owls in June.
It is evidently one of the  bend collective grounds
near Concord for to-day it was alive with birds.
A mixed flock conspiring at least 100 numbers
included two H. Chrysoptera (both shot), two D. black-
burnian, a Sitta canadensis, several D. Pennsylvanica
