1886
Sept. 30
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and warm with light S. W. wind.
  Started with Henshaw about 10 A. M. and 
waved up river nearly to Pantry Brook returning
late in the afternoon.
  In Dyan Brook meadow saw a pair of
Buteo lineatus sitting in the same tree and 
afterwards sailing about over the woods.
  From this point to the meadow above Lee's 
Bridge we saw literally nothing but a few
Rusy Blackbirds and an occasional Blue Jay.
We eat lunch nearly opposite the summer camps
and there beat the meadow starting nothing
but a solitary Tit lark which I shot.
  Returning to Fairhaven H. landed and concealed
himself in a cornfield near the base of Lee's Cliff
where he shot six Rusty Blackbirds in a short time.
I finally joined him and got two more.
They were feeding on the corn.
  While here a Black Duck passed us. It was 
literally the only water fowl seen during the 
day although. H. picked up a Grebe floating
belly up and not long dead.
  In the button bushes at the outlet to the Bay
great numbers of Rusty Black birds were letting
to roast at sunset, arriving in flocks of various
roses, from every point of the compass. Among them
was a single Red-wings, a firm adult male with flowing
shoulders and apparently coal black plumage. I 
started him three times but failed to get a shot.
He sang once-the full spring quou-ker-ee
  Twilight fell before we reached town and it was
