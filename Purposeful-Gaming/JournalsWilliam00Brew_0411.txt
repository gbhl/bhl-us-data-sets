1889
(Oct. 26)
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Although Killed dead by the shot I fired at him he
clung to the tree, apparently by his bill, so tenaciously that
I had to get Jim to cut it down.
  After lunch paddled up to Bottle Brook Pond. No
Ducks in it. We took in the boat & paddled all around
each of the coves. Found a dead Merganser in the grass.
Just below this pond three young men were camping. They
were hunting muskrats, they said & had killed two. A
Grouse drummed near their camp last night or rather
this morning between 2 & 3 o'clock. They had found his
log & intend to shoot him to-night.

  Went into Bear Brook on our way down but found it
frozen as far up as we could see.
  Rowed down to the Lake & went through Leonard's
Pond to Moose Point. Heard Ducks quacking in various
parts of the marsh but the water was so low we
could not get the bat in far. Saw one Black Duck
flying quacking loudly other answering him from the
meadow. Muskrats very numerous, sloshing & cutting silvery "wakes"
  The Megalloway was very peaceful and beautiful to-day.
A soft gray light over everything. Dead stillness
broken only by the occasional bark of a squirrel, the
chirping of a Chickadee or the screaming of Blue Jays.
The latter were very numerous and noisy. They are
exceedingly shy here.

  Saw two Hermit Thrushes on the shore of Bottle Brook
Pond. Started a Grouse near Pulpit Rock spring
& fired a snap shot at him but missed. Did
not get a shot at a Duck all day.

  In the Lake near the Carry saw two Horned Greebes
this morning. They were diving for food apparently.
The Lake is now as low as on September 18th.
