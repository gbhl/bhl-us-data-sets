1889
Oct. 18
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
The sun rose clear but clouds quickly gathered and the
remainder of the day was dark & cold with a high N.W. wind.
  The Great Horned Owl came to the dead hemlock nearly over 
my tent some time before daylight and waked me by
his hooting. I have never heard him utter anything but
the hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo, hoo variation. This near at hand
sounds soft and mournful almost like the cooing of a Dove.

  I rose at six. While waiting for breakfast, I observed 
Don sniffing the air and looking eagerly up the side
of the Knoll above our open camp. I ordered him on
when he "drew" about 30 yards and pointed. Taking the
20 gauge, I followed and presently espied the head of 
a Grouse bobbing up and down behind a log. I shot
her when two more rose, one going into a spruce where
I killed him with the second barrel, the other flying
out of sight.

  A little later a hawk which I think was a Pigeon Hawk 
came flying in from the Lake past the camp. I also
saw a high Redpoll Linnet in the birds over my head. A 
pair of Canada Jays visit the camp daily now.

  After breakfast we started for Rapid River, Jim taking 
"Don" and the duffle in his boat while I sailed the entire
distance in the Rushton canoe. On the way up river
to Cedar Stump we started seven Sheldrake. I fired a 
long shot at one but missed. Landed and I walked
up the old carry road to where it joins the new. Saw 
nothing so returned & built a fire. Two Pine Grosbeaks
flying about. A large flock of White-winged Crossbills 
chattering but invisible as usual, probably flying. Jim
finally returned with two Grouse. He had seen scores in all.

  Rowed to Whale's Back towing the canoe, a heavy sea
running. I went half over the top road but saw nothing.
  Had an exciting sail back to camp, the wind blowing a gale.
