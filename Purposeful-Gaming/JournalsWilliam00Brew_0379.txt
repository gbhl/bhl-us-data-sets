Lake Umbagog, Maine.
and after looking towards the ducks retire again. He afterwards 
proved to be merely a river driver after logs but he spoiled my
chance for I at once decided to paddle to the birds. As we
approached, a fine drake, in perfect plumage apparently, sailed
out into the open water & stretched up his neck. When we
were within about 60 yds. he started & all the others rose also.
I fired into the thick of them at about 80 yds. but failed to
stop any. One turned back & passed at about 50 yds. My
first barrel produced no effect but the second hit her so
hard that she came nearly to the water but finally
managed to rise enough to disappear among the trees.

  Next to Sweat Meadow. About 75 Black Ducks there. 
Tried to stalk them but the water was very high & they
kept well out feeding among the tops of the submerged
sedges. At one time the whole flock was within 100 yds. of me. 
They were very playful lashing the water with their wings
and sometimes diving both from on wing & while swimming
A fine adult male Greater Scaup Duck alighted with them in the 
open water. I finally shot at two that came within about
80 yds. but only wounded her slightly. Jim then
came down with the boat. The Ducks began to return
within five minutes. We paddled to some that alighted
in the grass but they rose at fully 40 yds. I missed with
my first but brought one down dead with the second barrel
at about 80 yds. Used the 20 gauge to-day.

  As Jim came down the pond he passed within 20 yards
of two Red Phalaropes. After the Ducks had gone we
went after the Phalaropes and I shot one on the water
and the other as it rose. They were just outside the
grass in the open water. They occasionally turned over 
on their sides like Bill[?] Auks.
