  Clear but very windy.
Ther about 28[degrees] - 40[degrees] - 
34[degrees]. Rose as usual..
Spent all the A.M.
in numbering my
eggs.
  In the P.M. H.
Henshaw came up &
I stuffed the Snow Bunting 
(male) shot yesterday,
& while so engaged Frank
Athinson and H. Read
called,  Still later H.
Henshaw left & R. Deane 
called in for a short
time. All of our carpets 
were sent up to the house
to day & everything is
in confusion.
  The sidewalks
are drying up and the
grass is beginning to look
green in sunny places.
Sunday, March 14, 1869.
  Clear and a day worthy
of April, although the
afternoon was rather
windy than otherwise.
Ther. about 32[degrees] - 60[degrees] -  
40[degrees]. Rose a little early,
shaved, and then going
out into the garden found
a pair of Bluebirds (the first
female of the season) inspecting
my boxes. On the way
down to church, saw
a Crow Blackbird, and
heard a Brown Creeper sing 
very faintly. After church,
walked up to the pond with
J. Nichols. Took dinner
at the Deane's and in the 
P.M. a long ride through
Waltham with Ruth.
Saw nine Robins, flying
over high in air.
  Wrote most of evening.
