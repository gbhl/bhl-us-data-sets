(March 24)
  I next  visited the Owl hole and found a
large number of Robin's feathers in the bottom but
no Owl. Chadbourne removed some pellets from the
ground beneath on the 22nd.
  In the birch run to the westward I started
a Rusty Grackle & saw more Titmice.
  Retracing my steps I crossed Prospect St. & in
the meadow near the maple swamp lot found about
25 Robins & as many Rusty Grackles feeding on
the bare ground along the open brook.
  Another large flock of Cedar Birds and a small
one of Purple Finches in the cedars to the
south of this meadow. Also flushed two Grouse
in some hazel & andromeda bushes near a sp[?]
run at the east end of these cedar woods.
  In an orchard below I heard Red Crossbills
calling & soon made out a flock of about
a dozen sitting in the top of an apple tree,
their feathers ruffled so that they looked nearly
as large as Robins. I shot one when the others
took wing & once and keeping over the open
fields to the south disappeared in the distance.
  Despite the cold blustering weather I saw
this morning at least four times as many birds
as on the 22nd over the same ground. They
were also, as a rule, singing more freely although
the Bluebirds to-day were wholly silent &
Song Sparrows nearly so.
