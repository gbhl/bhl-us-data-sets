1890
Oct. 6
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Clear and cold with high N.W. wind. A blustering, disagreeable
day.
  We left camp at eleven o'clock. Melvin in my old boat with 
Bill Sargent I in the new boat with Jim.
  As we neared the mouth of the river a flock of 14
Pectoral Sandpipers came whisking over the water past
us. I fired both barrel into them getting four with the
first and one with the second. Melvin killed six
with one barrel & missed with the second.

  We then tried the Snipe marsh flushing five birds
on one little point. M. killed two and two went
across the river one into Leonards Pond, the other
alighting on the bare clayey bank and after a little
following the first. The fifth bird dropped in the marsh
where I put it up twice shooting both barrels at it
each time and missing it with all four shots. M.
marked it down within a few rods but we could
not flush it again.

  We lunched at the entrance to Leonard's Pond
and then paddled through the pond and out
into the Lake by way of Moose Point. Started two
Black Ducks near the end of the island and saw
fully 100 Robins in one flock evidently migrants
just in from the North. There was a Flicker & a
Rusty Blackbird with them.

  Mrs Richardson's [?] M. flushed & killed another
Snipe. The report of his gun started three Greater Yellow
legs from Moose Point.  I followed them to the 
Outlet while M. went to Whale-back & Brandy Ledge
[?] for Ducks. I found the Yellow-legs on a mud
flat on the south side of the Outlet and near them
