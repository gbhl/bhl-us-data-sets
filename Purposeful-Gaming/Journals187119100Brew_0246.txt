Lake Umbagog, Maine.
of them. While here saw a Marsh Hawk on the mud-flats rising
and settling many times like a Cull and picking at something in
the mud. It was an adult male.
  Lunched here, the guides cooking two Ducks.  Deer tracks
very numerous. Saw an Eagle, a flock of Pine Linnets, two Fox
Sparrows, and heard a Picordis arcticus. On the way down Mel-
vin shot a Yellow Leg (T. melanoleuca) near the mouth of the Cam-
bridge and also started a Rail on the snipe ground. He said it
was the smallest Rail he had ever seen, but he saw no white
or wings. Probably a small P. Carolina. He shot one and I two
musk-rats. He found no Snipe, but one rose and flew over us in
the twilight.

Oct. 19
  Clear, frosty at sunrise, the woods and meadows as white as
snow with hoar frost.  Middle of the day still and warm.  Spent
the day up the Cambridge. Melvin started first with Alva and 
Lumen and I spent an hour beating the snipe ground. Did not 
start a single Snipe.  Heard Shore Larks and one Titlark piping
over the mud-flats. A White-bellied Nuthatch calling in the
woods. A Browned Grackle flying from stub to stub chuck-
ling hoarsely and once calling cr-rais.  A Hairy Woodpecker
tapping and calling in the distance. No other birds seen or heard.

  Started up river at ten o'clock. Just above the first bay-
ou or "logan" came up a Grouse standing erect ans still on
the back and shattered his head at close range just as he was
beginning to run. During the rest of the paddle up to the forks
saw nothing more interesting than tree Sitta canadenisis and a 
few Chickades and Juncos. Found Melvin waiting at the forks.
He had shot noting and he failed to find a Wood drake seen in
the river yesterday by Baker. Alva was off looking for Grouse
as soon returned with one. Lunched one the sunny edge of the 
woods and the forks, cooking two ducks. A apir of Parus hudson-
icus came along and I shot one. After lunch Alva started off
again and I soon went in pursuit of a Hylotomus which was making
a great racket in the swamp. Failed to get a shot, but while 
listening heard a loud rustling and saw a mouse bustling about 
in the dry leaves.  Shot at it and was searching in the leaves
where it had been sitting, when another and louder rustling at-
tracted my attention. The sound approached steadily and pres-
ently a very large fine Grouse appeared, stalking gracefully
through the bushes, nodding his head at each step. After watch-
ing him a few moments I shot him. Failed to find the mouse.
