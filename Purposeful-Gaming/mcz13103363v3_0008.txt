a robin and a blue jay that
he had stuffed since I was
up there last. Starting

William got hurt by falling off my horse
Also called. Went up to the Russells in [?]
Cloudy all day. Had a most
gorgeous sunrise. Went
shooting in A.M. starting
at 6, but did not get a shot
at any thing. Watched a
golden winged woodpecker for
some time & saw a snow bunting
and a large flock of redpolls with
a few gold finches intermixed.
Got home at 10, got some breakfast
and was off again. Shot a female
white bellied nuthatch. Saw 
several flocks of redpolls but neither
robins nor cedar birds. Saw song and
tree sparrows but no fox colors for
several weeks. Set a squirrel trap
with Charlie in P.M. & while away
Dan came down and Dick.
