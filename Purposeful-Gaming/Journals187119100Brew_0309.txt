(June 6)
Bitterns booming, in the second smaller area between
the two Nayland bridges, two more.There was a 
fifth above the railroad bridge and a sixth above
the upper bridge when I left my boat for the night.
  In the meadow between the two bridges I heard
two bird notes quite new to me. One which came
every few seconds from a tangled morass of flags, cat tails, 
and button rushes on the margin of the river was a  
quavering coo very like that of the tawn pigeon, a
coo - hoo - hoo, sometimes coo - hoo - hoo - hoo. I thought it might
be a Gallinule. This cry ceased as I sailed past but
was soon renewed and continued until nearly dark.
The other stranger was in a dense bed of canary grass
into which I [?][?][?]ed the canoe to rest and enjoy the 
sights and sounds connected with the sunset hour.
While sitting here perfectly still some bird within a 
few yards of me began calling kloc - kloc - kloc, very
much like a hen but in harder tones.Could it have
been a Least Bittern ? ( I heard another the following day)
  For nearly an hour I remained in this spot enjoying
every moment for the surrounding marshes were alive
with interesting birds. Red - wings gurgling, Marsh Hens 
uttering their queer little bubbling songs, Rails (both species)
calling on every side, three Bitterns (one within fifty yards)
booming. Among the reeds unseen creatures rustling, plashing
and gurgling; in the distant woods the voices of [?]
and Oven Birds. After sunset Redwings, Bitterns, Marsh
Hens, an occasional Rail and a deafening chorus
of green frogs (no bull frogs this afternoon or evening).
  Paddling to the last bridge I concealed the canoe in
the rushes and took my way along the road to the hotel
passing a moment ere I left the meadow to listen. A Bittern
still booming and the quak of a bright Heron the only bird voices.
