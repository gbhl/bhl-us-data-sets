1888
Sept. 21.
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Cloudy with heavy rain all P.M.
Wind strong from the east. Lake rather
rough, air misty, mountains obscured
by clouds. To Rapid River in A.M. with
Skillings and Hill. At entrance started
a Sheldrake. Below Pines a pair of Whist-
lers. Below Cedar Stump five Black Ducks
and seven Sheldrake. The former passed
over S. and H. and they killed one
which "Don" found in the woods. We
got within a long shot of the Sheldrake
and I fired at one as they rose but failed
to get him. After luncheon, started back in
a pouring rain. A flock of Sheldrake at
Pine Point cove. A flock of 20 Black Ducks
in Moose Point pond hole. Did not get
shot at either. Saw six Snipe flying in
a bunch like Plover. They dropped in
Moose Point marsh. We followed them
about there for an hoiur or two and
killed every bird. I bagged four of
the six. I also shot a Virginia Rail
which "Don" pointed.
