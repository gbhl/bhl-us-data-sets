1887
May 26
Concord, Massachusetts.
Clear and hot with light E. wind.
  In the forenoon took a rather long drive
east of town, following the turnpike to the
sentinal pine in Lexington, then over some
cross roads new to me to Lincoln and back 
by way of Sandy Pond woods.
  Birds singing rather freely. Heard four
Wood thrushes, three Indigo Birds, several
Yellow-winged Sparrows, about six Grosbeaks,
and two Golden-wings (H. Chrysoptera) the
latter in Sandy Pond woods. Pursued one of 
them but did not get a shot. Tried at
a Canada Flycatcher that was singing on
the edge of a swamp but missed.
  In P.M. took another drive with C., to
Carlisle and back over the road by the Brown
form. Heard two more Wood Thrushes, three
Yellow-winged Sparrows, three or four Bobolinks
& the usual common birds.
  Heard only two Tanagers to-day. They seem
to be scare this year.
  A few Black-poll Warblers still singing 
in the pines near the monument.
