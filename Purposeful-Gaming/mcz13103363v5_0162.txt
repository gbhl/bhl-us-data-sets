Rose at 5 A.M. and
went down to the pond.
As I went out of the door
a Mottled Owl was hooting
in front of the door. At
the pond shot a Red Owl in
the Grove. Then tried to creep
on to a Grebe on the further
side. Coming back sculled
on to a Hooded Merganser
in the boat house cove and
shot him. Got home at

the day in making skins
and did twelve.
Lophodytes Cucullatus, shot
one on Fresh pond.
