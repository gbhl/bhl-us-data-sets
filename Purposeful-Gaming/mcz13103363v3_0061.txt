Ther. about 38[degrees] - 50[degrees] - 40. My clock

rats and three snipe flying. Fired
at a quail flying. Saw three quail,
about 20 snipe, several rusty blackbirds,
several fox colored sparrows,
a snow bird, & two tawny thrushes.
Jack 'treed' a quail & started a rabbit.
Got home at 10.30 A.M. After getting
some 'grub', skinned a musk rat &
plucked the snipe. Took a ride on Tiger

musk rats starting at 4.45 P.M. Shot one
at the foot of the lane. Saw five or six in

Sunday, April 21, 1867
  Pleasant and a most lovely
day with a light southerly
breeze. Ther. about 40[degrees] - 60[degrees]
50[degrees]. Went to church and
sabbath school in A.M.
but Mr. Thipple was
absent. Read the first part of
the P.M. & stretched the last
musk rat shot yesterday as I
did not have time to last
night. Rode up to Dan's in P.M.
with father but found nobody
at home. Met Dan coming
home. Father got out a Mr.
Payson's and I drove home the
rest of the way. Looked over
my Latin a little in the evening.
We have got corn & peas planted
and lettuce set out.
