Revere Beach, Massachusetts.
  Cloudy with occasional light showers; warm.
  To revere Beach with Chadbourne by 9 a.m. train.
Left the cars at Point of Pines and first inspected'
the pines behind the large hotel in hopes of finding
Crossbills there. There were English Sparrows in
abundance and four Tree Sparrows (S. monticola) but
nothing else save a single Robin. In the bushy thickets
around the outskirts of the grove Song Sparrows
swarming as usual at this season and, despite
the gloomy weather, singing freely. We saw none
elsewhere along the beach although they used to
be numerous during migration time at several
places, especially Oak Island.

  Near the extreme end of the Point we came on
a flock of about 15 Pine Linnets feeding among
weeds on the side of a dyke embankment. Firing
two barrels into these killed eight.

  Retracing our steps to the station & crossing the
railroad we next tried the marshes. There were no
small birds there but we saw a flock of about
30 Crows (evidently migrants), about as many
Golden-eye Duck feeding in the river, and numerous
Herring Gulls.
  The rest of the way to Oak Island we kept along
the beach ridge. Pine Linnets are exceedingly
numerous the entire distance, in flocks of 5 to 15 birds
each. We shot nine more specimens. I made one
capital shot at a single bird passing very swiftly
before the strong S. E. wind.
  Besides the Linnets we saw a single Snow Bunting,
& many English Sparrows, the latter feeding on the
wet beach in flocks. Returned to the city at 12 n.
