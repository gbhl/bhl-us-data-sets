MAN'S DIRECTION-SENSE 147

would settle down and live quite contentedly until, 
when another bad spell in the weather occurred after 
six or twelve months, he would disappear again, and 
this state of things continued as long as he lived. 
The explanation of Moro's action is, I fancy,

We know that animals are capable of visualising 
past scenes in this way. I have given instances of this 
faculty and the delusions it gives rise to, in writing 
of the horse and guanaco in my Naturalist in La Plata. 
It remains to speak of the sense of direction in
