Sept. 25  
down to and often overhung the water. This green growth,
seen only now about ponds not subject to flowage, was here
largely abor vitae.
  Less than half-a-mile above the sluice we surprised a flock
of Ducks composed of two Sheldrake and five Hooded Mergansers.
I got a long shot as they rose and stopped [o??] of ca[??] Spie[??}
Further on a flock of five Black Ducks came swimming around
a bend as we were approaching it. Curiously enough they did
not seem to notice us at first but [?fed] steadily along towards us.
At about 60 yds., however, they stretched up their necks and I
fired killing one and wounding another which only went a
few hundred yards, &[and] which I afterwards flushed &[and] shot. There was
a single Wood duck, a [female], among them.

  After the shallow water began we made too much noise that
I did not get another show all the way to the pond. Near
its outlet in a grassy cove we discovered a flock of about 15
Black Ducks feeding. I was starting to stalk them when
a Bald Eagle sailed out over the trees and they rose in great
alarm disappearing up the pond. A Wood drake also rose
at the same time from a neighboring cove & made off.

  Duncan next paddled around the pond leaving we concealed at
the outlet. Two Black Ducks soaring high in air were all I saw.
We then paddled down the pond together. Discovered a Scoter
near the middle. He was shy rising twice at 75. I wounded
him first time & brought him down the second but he took to
diving and escaped.

  Returned late in the afternoon. Just after reaching the dead
water we surprised a flock of about 15 Black Ducks feeding in a
little nook in the grass. I killed three with my first barrel & brought
down a fourth wing-tipped with my second. A fifth lagged
behind the flock but escaped. We reached camp about dark.
