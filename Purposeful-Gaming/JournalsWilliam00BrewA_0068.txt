Suwanee River, Florida.
of the water but missed it. We then landed
and watched a bare muddy flat ahead 
of the fire but nothing came out there.
I then returned to my canoe and quickly
killed a Clapper Rail (which proved to be
R. [?]), and a Marsh Hare both of
which [ran?] out a hundred yards or more
ahead of the fire. I also shot a peculiar
Swamp Sparrow. Started three Snipe on
the island and missed a fair shot at
one of them. Besides the Clapper I saw
a Virginia Rail distinctly but failed to
get a shot at it. There were several pairs 
of Red-winged Blackbirds on this island;
also some Long-billed Marsh Wrens in
a growth of low cane brake.
  The river is fresh water quite to its mouth
and, indeed, as far out into the Gulf as
I went in my canoe (100 yds or more)
Nevertheless several huge porpoises were rolling
and puffing in the channels among
the outer islands. There were no beaches 
or sand bars visable a fact which
may account for the absence of Gulls
and waders generally.
  We started up river early in the afternoon
sailing most of the distance home before
a fresh S.E. breeze  locking our canoes
together.
