scarcely dismounted when a large flock of
Sanderling whirled past and in their rear a
dense cluster of larger birds into which I fired
bringing down [?] which proved to be Stilt
Sandpipers. The shores of this pond were literally
covered with the footprints of Crows, Opossums 
and Wild Cats. I also shot a Bonaparte's Gull.
  We lunched here, the sun very hot no birds
singing. A Shrike perched on a bush on the 
edge of the pond.
  Started back at 2 P.M. changing horses. My
animal began to rear and buck and I threw my gun
into the grass and dismounted. Robert then tried
it and the next instant both horse and man
went over backwards and sideways into a cluster of
Spanish Bayonet plants. Both were [?severely?/?seriously?] [?]
of course.  We then took off the saddle and I 
mounted and rode home bareback, the horse quiet 
enough. A larger [?bunch] of Sandling [?Sanderling] and two 
Buffle-heads on the beach.
  Reaching the house Cory and I crossed the
creek in a boat. Found the flats literally alive
with waders chiefly "Peeps" with about fifteen
Stilt Sandpipers and [?] Red-breasted Snipe. I fired 
three shots among these and got [?] Snipe and 
four Stilts. Cory put out some decoys and shot a
pair of Lesser Yellow-legs. I beat a long line 
of tall hedge for A. [?] but only [?] [?]
Swamp and Savanna Sparrow. Two Marsh Wrens
(palustris) were singing and we flushed a Bittern 
from the edge of a small pond.
  Back to the house at sunset.
