could not be found. It looked like a Green-wing.
  Henshaw and I landed again on the 
Great Meadow and pursued the Lit Larks for 
an hour or more firing a number of flying shots
at these and killing six of which I got four.
There were at least one hundred them this
evening. They were rather sly as usual.
  During the day we saw surreal Marsh Hawks
and four Great Blue Herons. Of small birds
we noticed very few indeed; but then the weather
was unfavorable for them, windy and cold.
  Hill and Jones whom we met started river
Grouse.
