(1889)
(June 16)
Spotted Sandpiper skimming close over the water. A Grosbeak
and Wilson's Thrush singing and a Blue Jay calling (like a
Red-shouldered Hawk) in the distance. Around us Marsh Wrens
singing and scolding and Red-wings singing. The Bitterns
pumping (sometimes two at the same time) as late as
8.10 P. M. but ceasing entirely after that. We were interested
to observe that as twilight deepened the Eave Swallows
all disappeared and Bank Swallows took their places. The
latter we had not seen at all before but now they
came around us by dozens skimming over the water
until it was almost too dark to follow their movements.
  After it had become fairly dark the bull frogs, which
had sung only intermittently & one at a time before, began
to give us some of their choicest selections with a full
chorus of a dozen or more performers [delete]each time[/delete] some
of them among the grass but the majority floating in
mid-stream among the potamogeton beds. Some of them
uttered the peculiar low whistle, which neither Torrey nor
Faxon had heard before. I believe it is made by
drawing in the breath just before each bellow. The
bass of some of these frogs was of fine quality but
near at hand their combined clamor was rather
deafening.
  While listening to the bull frogs I caught the distant
call of a kik-kik-kik-cree bird. Rowing up river
we found that it came from the brook meadow just
above the railroad bridge. Landing and walking 
out on the embankment several hundred yards
we got within a hundred yards of the bird and
now heard no less than four others at various
distances. About once a minute we also heard a
