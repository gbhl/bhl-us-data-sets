WHAT I HAVE DONE WITH BIRDS 
berlost yielded me the only complete series of Vulture studies ever 
made, dozens of studies of other birds, material for a novel, more 
natural history stuff than could be put into several big volumes, 
many rare specimens and much priceless experience in swamp 
work, for all of which I acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr. 
Bolds, to Little Chicken and to the Deacon.
