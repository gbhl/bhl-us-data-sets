island. These have been examined by Dr. Ami and Mr. Lambe, 
whose determinations will be found in Apendix iv. The 
fossils show that the rocks contain a fauna closely resembling 
that of the Lake Winnipeg basin, and extend over a period from 
the Galena-Trenton to the Guelph and Niagara, or from the 
upper part of the Cambro-Silurian to high up in the Silurian. 
Soundings taken on the even bottom of Fisher strait show 
that the limestones extend without a break to Coats island (to 
the southward of Southampton), where they occupy all of its 
surface except the portion at the east end of the island where 
the Archaean ridge crosses it. A few fossils from Mansfield 
island show that it also is formed of limestones of these 
horizons. 
At Cape Chidley a collection of fossils from loose pieces of 
limestone corresponds with fossils from Akpatok island, and the 
direction of ice movement out of Hudson strait leaves little 
doubt that the loose limestone of Chidley came from that island. 
These fossils show a slightly wider range in age than the rocks 
of Southampton do; they extend from the Lower Galena- 
Trenton to the Lower Heidelberg. 
West Coast of Hudson Bay. 
The wide fringe of limestones which is found along the west 
shores of Hudson bay to the southward of Churchill do not come 
within the limits of this report. To the northward only 
Archaean rocks are found along the mainland until the northern 
half of Melville peninsula is reached, where Parry describes a 
wide area of sandstone, probably the base of the Cambro-Silu- 
rian, as separating the highlands of the interior from the 
western shores of the northern part of Fox channel. These 
rocks are continued on the north side of Fury and Hecla strait, 
where they are found on the west side of Baffin island fronting 
on Prince Regent inlet.
