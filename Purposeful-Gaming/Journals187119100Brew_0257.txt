at full speed, thin long white "flags" held erect and
flashing in the sunlight or gleaming in the darker places.
Often this white gleam was the only thing seen for the 
general coloring of the animal harmonized wonderfully
with the russet oak leaves and soft gray trunks and 
twigs. These deer were wonderfully graceful animals
when in motion. Nevertheless they reminded me most of 
gigantic rabbits, or rather, hares, with their long ears,
timid ways, and irregular bounding action.
  Besides the deer we saw only pigeons, of which
there were hundreds inhabiting dove-cotes erected in
the woods on poles, and small birds in great numbers.
Of the latter Nuthatchers (S. canadusis) were literally swarming
(I saw not less than thirty) and Crossbills (L. annircana),
Pine Limenets, Gold finches, King legs (R. lateapa) Brown
Grumpers, Chickadees and Free Sparrows numerous.
  Of small mammals we saw one muskrat and 
several red squirrels. Not a shot was fired.
  After dinner I was driven to a duck started on
one of the creeks in the marsh when I lay for surreal
hours without seeing a Duck, - although we started
about thirty A. obscura where we approached the place.
Herring Gulls were flying about over the creeks, a 
Bittern passed me about sunset, and Shott-eand Owl
was seen hawking over the Sand-hills in the distance.
There was also a great flock of Meadow Larks which
apparently assembled to roost in the beach grass bordering
the marsh.  I fired two shots at them and killed
one but could not find it. I also shot a Pas. [?]
on the sand hills and at twilight saw another which
came from the S and hills and alighted far out
in the marsh.
