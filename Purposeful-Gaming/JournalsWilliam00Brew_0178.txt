of the way often passing through beds of reeds which
rustled musically against the sides of the boat. The
sunset was a rather dull one but the scene was very
restful with the great expanse of water hemmed in by
russet woodland and dark green pines.
  Near the middle of the Sudbury Marshes saw a
flock of seven Scaup Ducks (F. marila ?) which flew
irregularly over the marsh many times now rising against
the sky now pitching down & skimming closer over
the water. Also saw four Red-winged Blackbirds, 
two flying high, two rising from a bed of tall reeds
alarmed by our boat.
  Just above the lower Wayland bridge three Ducks
which looked very like Widgeon flew swiftly past
us near;y within range. It was nearly dark
by this time and quite so when we reached
our destination. The water was so very high
that we paddled up the brook nearly to the
hotel where we spent the night.
