Sept. 29
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Clear with high N.W. wind. A superb, bracing day.
  In camp all day skinning birds. Jim shot two Grouse 
near the camp and I a third which came within
15 yds. of our fire but which I followed nearly quarter
of a mile back into the woods. Finally killed him
over a steady point. He was squatting on a bed of green
moss under large hemlocks. I saw his glistening eye
first, then made out his head and finally the
whole bird.

Sept. 30
Cloudy threatening rain which came at sunset and 
lasted all night.
  To B. pond this morning with Chadbourne 
Jim & Will Sargent. Near the steamer landing
C[hadborne] shot five Grouse. I got two on the way to 
the pond, one of which was sitting in a corner
of an old log camp the roof of which had fallen
in.

  We expected Whitney to meet us at the pond with 
a boat but he was not there. Accordingly we
had to embark on two rafts which we were
lucky enough to find. The wind rose soon after
we started & the trout stopped rising. We fished
about three hours C[hadbourne] getting a small trout, I
nothing. Saw a Loon and two Scoters in 
the pond. A Barred Owl began hooting 
at about 5 p.m. and continued at intervals
until we went to sleep. We spent the night
in a comfortable little bark shanty on the island.
White-winged Crossbills chattering near the lumber camps. 
Five Sitta carolinensis there. Also many sparrows.
