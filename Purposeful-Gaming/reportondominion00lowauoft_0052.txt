16 CRUISE of THE NEPTUNE 
the day, two large white bears were killed by the hunters. The 
first was seen climbing along the steep cliffs fronting the har- 
bour, the second being found in a deep hole that it had dug 
into a large snowbank, on the side of a high hill, and into which 
it had retired for a cool 
Erik cove is an excellent harbour formed by a wide gully 
in the high hills of this part of the coast. The bay extends 
inland about two miles from the general coast-line; and good 
anchorage is found within a quarter of a mile of its head. On 
both sides, hills from 800 feet to 1,500 feet afford good protec- 
tion against all but north winds. Unfortunately the bay is 
V-shaped, and quite open to the north, so that with strong 
winds from that direction it would be unsafe, and, during the 
season of ice, the danger would be considerably enhanced, as, 
owing to its shape, the ice would be liable to block, and to force 
a ship on shore without much chance of escape. A small river 
which flows down the continuation of the gorge winds from side 
to side of a low plain, which narrows as it extends backwards 
from the sea, up the valley. An excellent site for houses might 
be found on the plain near the mouth of the river. 
HUDSON BAY. 
Squalls of snow delayed us until the afternoon of the 13th, 
when we steamed westward along the north side of Digges 
islands. A bear was seen climbing over the cliffs, and a boat 
was lowered in chase, but the animal escaped. In the evening, 
the course was changed to northward, up Fox channel. At day- 
light the next morning ice was met with some ten miles from 
Leyson point. Steaming slowly through it, Seahorse point, on 
Southampton island, was reached at noon, and a landing was 
made with the launch. During the absence of the launch, the 
ship was sent out into the ice to the northeast, in order to
