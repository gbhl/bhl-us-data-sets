white beneath with a few 
feathers of a yellowis red
color near the tail; the tail
itself unlike that of a 
woodpecker or a creper is
soft and does not appear
to be used much in climbing
the sound that it makes much
resembles the creaking of two
limbs together. I shot this
Nuthatch and have him in
my collection of birds.
(Saw one the 22nd of June)
  Song Sparrow
[margin]Feb 22, 1865[/margin]
  I saw a large flock of 
Tree Sparrows and Song Sparrows
on the other side of Fresh Pond
I shot one Song Sparrow
and two Tree Sparrows.
The Tree Sparrows come to
us only in winter they are
reddish brown above and dirty
white beneath with an almost
imperceptible spot of slate
where the neck joins the body.
  American Goldfinch

  Last seen in Thanksgiving
week. I did not see this bird
but heard it so plainly
