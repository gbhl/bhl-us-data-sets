to a certain extent; but they exhibit no 
high mental development. Some indi- 
viduals become very tame, though they 
display no particular affection for their 
master and keeper. They always revert 
to their grosser animal instincts in old 
age, for then they become wicked, in- 
tractable and violent. The Bears signify 
their various moods by modulations of 
their remarkable voices, finding utterance 
in dull growling, snorting and murmur- 
ing, or grunting, whistling and sometimes 
barking sounds." 
A family of young Bears consists of 
from one to six, which are fed and pro- 
tected in the most tender manner by their 
watchful and careful mother. Born naked 
and blind, it is usually five or six weeks 
before they can see and have a season- 
able coat of hair. After this, they are 
full of life and very playful, and their 
antics are very amusing. 
Bears may be classed under three 
groups; the Sea Bears, the Land Bears 
and the Honey Bears. 
The Polar or White Bear is the only 
representative of the first class. This 
species has been wonderfully provided for 
by Nature. Living as it does in the re- 
gions of perpetual ice and snow, the pure 
white color of its fur becomes a protec- 
tion, as it is less easily observed. It also, 
unlike the other species, has the soles of 
its feet covered with hair which enables 
it to move more freely and safely on the 
ice. They have been noted at a distance 
of fully fifty miles from the nearest shore, 
swimming without effort and showing no 
fatigue. 
One of the best known of the Land 
Bears is the Brown Bear of Northern 
Europe and Asia. It varies greatly and 
some authorities divide it into several dis- 
tinct species. It is easily tamed and be- 
cause of the ease with which it supports 
itself on its hind feet it is often taught 
to step to the sound of music. Here also 
is classed the Grizzly Bear, which is near- 
ly as large as the Polar Bear and much 
more ferocious. It has been known to 
attack the bison and carry a body weigh- 
ing one thousand pounds or more to its 
den some distance away. 
The Black Bear of our illustration is 
also a member of this class. It is a native 
of the wooded parts of North America. 
This species is timid though agile, strong 
and is of great endurance. Its fur is soft 
and even and shining black in color. It 
can run more swiftly than can a man and 
will escape in this manner if possible. 
Though it principally feeds on herbs, 
fruits and grains, it will also devour live 
stock of the smaller kinds and may even 
attack cattle. In captivity they are much 
better natured than the other species. 
"They never make hostile use of their 
strength in their relations with their 
keepers, but completely acknowledge hu- 
man supremacy and present no difficul- 
ties in their training. At any rate, they 
fear their keeper more than he does 
them." 
The third class is illustrated by a sin- 
gle species, the Sloth, or Honey Bear, 
also called the Aswal. It is a native of 
India and frequents hilly localities. It 
feeds upon fruits, honey and the lower 
animals, such as ants and the grubs of 
various insects. It also enjoys the comb 
and honey of bees. With its large and 
scythe-shaped claws it will destroy the 
strongly built homes of the white ants. 
In its native country the Sloth is trained 
by jugglers to perform many tricks and 
in captivity it is docile and comparatively 
good-natured.
