228 cruise OF THE NEPTUNE 
detached outliers (which I do not venture to outline) on the 
Cape rawson beds, shown by these authors to characterize the 
region generally. Bituminous coal was found at Lincoln bay, 
half a degree north of the mouth of Lady Franklin sound, on 
the east Grinnell land coast, in different parts of the Bellows 
valley (which runs inland to the north of the same sound) to 
the head, and in the neighbourhood of Lake Hazen, to the west- 
ward, by Capt. Greely. Lieut. Brainard also describes in an 
appendix a fossil forest discovered by him in Archer fiord, a 
few miles west of Cape Baird, which, with the associated rocks, 
is without doubt referable to the Tertiary. Toward the head of 
Chandler fiord (running west of Lady Franklin sound) Greely 
mentions high cliffs of ' schistose slate,' and in Ruggles river, 
the outlet of Lake Hazen, large slabs of ' slate,' which had been 
used by the Eskimos in building their huts. Brainard speaks 
of the cliffs of Beatrix bay as dark, those of Ella bay as very 
light, in colour. These bays constitute the termination of 
Archer fiord. He remembers the cliffs on Musk-ox valley to 
have been again of dark colours. Respecting Greely fiord, on 
the west coast of Grinnell land, he quotes from his diary : ' On 
the north shore of this fiord the line of cliffs presents a feature 
of marked peculiarity; horizontal lines or strata of different 
colours run uniformly for miles along their face.' He adds: 
' The predominating colours in these lines and of the cliffs was 
a pale-yellow. On the south side, where we were camped, the 
cliffs were of about the same colour as those spoken of above, 
but the strata were not noticed. They were from 1,500 to 
8,000 feet above the sea-leVel, and presented a castellated ap- 
pearance. Fossils in great numbers were found here.' 
To the west of the narrows of Ponds inlet, the high hills of 
crystalline rock retreat from the southern shore of the inlet, 
leaving a wide plain of stratified sand, gravel and clay, which 
extends far to the west and southwest, and is penetrated by a
