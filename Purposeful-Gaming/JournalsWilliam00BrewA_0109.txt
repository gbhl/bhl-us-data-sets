Cambridge, Mass.
Clear and warm. Wind S.W. a pleasant, soft breeze all day.
  To the Fresh Pond swamps this morning, starting
about 9 o'clock, driving to Alewife Brook and walking
home. Within five minutes after my buggy had driven
off and before I entered the swamp at all I heard
as I stood on the causeway over the brook nineteen
different species of birds as follows: Sylvania pusilla, one;
Seiurus noveboracensis, two; Empidonax [minimius?] two; Parula,
one; D. aestiva, four; M. melodia, two; M. palustris, one;
Spinus tristis, one; [?] carolinensis, one; Turdus [fuscater?]
one; Butorides virescens, one; Porzana carolina, one; Vireo
flavifrons, one; V. olivaceous, one; Geothlypis trichas, one;
Rallus virginianus, one; Setophaga ruticilla, one; Agelains
phoeniceus, several, and Hydemeles ludoviciana, one.
To this list I added during the forenoon D. striata,
D. coronate, [delete]and[/delete] [Nycteardea?] sinaia and Loxia minor
besides, of course, additional individuals of most of
the species above enumerated. Although evidently there
was no very heavy flight on this ground there was 
a fair showing of migrants and a large representation
of such summer residents as find congenial houses 
in these swamps. Of the former class the Water Thrushes
were the most numerous and I was rarely out of
hearing of one or more of them. Of the latter class
Yellow Warblers and Swamp Sparrows took the lead.
The Crossbills (three birds) were flying low over the
trees.
  The maples were still nearly bare but the willows cast
a thin shade and showed very green. The undergrowth
of shad bush, viburnums etc. was far advaced*[advanced] in
foliage. The grass in the meadows was six to twelve
inches high. The shad bush was out of flower and
