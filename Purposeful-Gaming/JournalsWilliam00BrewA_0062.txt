Suwanee River, Florida.
of a creek. After a short smoke we then
paddled up this creek together. Started a
pair of Wood Ducks and Chapman found
a dead one, a drake, whose head had been
eaten off by some bird or mammal of prey.
He also shot a Water Thrush (S. motacilla).
I got a fine [male] Bachman's Warbler which I shot
from my boat dropping it into the water.
We saw a dead opossum at which a dozen
or more huge cat-fish were tugging dragging
it about with much splashing. 
I went ashore at one place to look at
some Warblers in the tree tops and
nearly stepped on a huge moccasin which
was lying on the bank. It tumbled 
clumsily into the creek before I could
shoot it. 
  We are now within the influence of the 
tide which rises and falls a foot or
more daily but the water is still fresh.
  Late in the afternoon they got the
scow under way and picking us up on 
the way down we tied to the bank for 
the night at a landing were many red 
cedar logs lay piled & which is probably
"Cedar Landing". Carolina Wrens, Cardinals
& Tufted Tits singing at sunset. Heard Barred
Owls in the distance.  Several Yellow-crowned
Night Herons flying about at twilight. Their
quak*[quack] is similar to that of N. nivaea but
higher pitched and more cracked or
harsher.
