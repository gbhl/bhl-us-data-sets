Monday, January 29, 1866.
  Saw an immense flock of
snow buntings flying: they
feed at this season (as do also
snow birds tree sparrows and gold finches)
on the seeds of certain tall bank
weeds.
Wednesday, January 31, 1866.
  I heard plainly a flock of cherry
birds which are the first.
I do not think that the
blue jays are around now
for I have been to all 
their haunts without seeing any.
Thursday, February 1, 1866.
  A mottled owl was seen to
day; seen again on the 4th;
shot on the 5th.
