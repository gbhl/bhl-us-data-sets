his "wisest farmer in America" is also a most delightful and practical 
writer on the wide subject of farm life and practice. In this book he 
enters a new field and goes to the root of many problems that have 
long perplexed farmers and their families. The author's genial style and 
shrewd, clear, unbiased discussion of such topics as "The Selection and 
Purchase of Farms," "The Farm as a Source of Income," "Locating the 
House," "Planning Rural Buildings," "Building the House" (including in 
three chapters the general plans, outside covering, painting, etc., inside 
finish, heating and ventilation), "water-supply and Sewage," "House-fur- 
nishing," "The Home Yard," "A Discussion of Barns," etc., will make this 
book a great favorite in its series, and a great help to all who purchase 
new farms or remodel old ones. To scores of farm-owners it will be a 
revelation of how much there is to enjoy on the farm and how to make 
the most of it.
