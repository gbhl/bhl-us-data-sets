were scattered all over the marsh in large
flocks. As usual they are absurdly tame.
  In the afternoon we hunted Quail starting
two bevies, one of four birds only (killed them
all) in pine woods, the other of about 18
in tall broom grass. From the latter we shot
four birds.
  On the way home saw two Buteo L. alleni
sitting in low pines by the roadside. One, a
young bird, allowed us to pass within 20 yds.
We also saw several Ardea wardi and one
A. egretta, about ponds in the woods.
  On the drive out in the morning saw my
first Florida Jays, two, in oak scrub by
the roadside. They were very tame and
I easily secured both of them.
