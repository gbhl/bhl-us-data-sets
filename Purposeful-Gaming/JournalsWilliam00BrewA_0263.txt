Dense cluster like Tringae and soon alighted all together.
We paddled carefully up to them and could see a
dozen or more running about on the bare mud
and probing. As they rose a second time I killed
two at one shot. After this we chased them
about for several hours and I shot three more &[and]
Melvin two. They were exceedingly shy after rising
200 yds off. In every instance they alighted on the edge
of the water and made no attempt to conceal them-
selves. I watched one for fully thirty minutes at a distance
of about 20 ft using my most powerful glass. It was
feeding most of the time much in the manner of a
Sandpiper but occasionally probing with half opened bill.
It looked very plump & the light stripes on the back were
very conspicuous showing as perfectly straight stripes.
I shot it & opened the stomach which was filled with
fragments of water beetles & small worms. I made a low purring noise which was answered by others.
  There were about 50 Robins in the woods & along the 
water's edge.  There was much singing among them chiefly
by young birds. All this time the snow was falling
thick and fast.

  We lunched in the grit building a large fire. At
evening we went to Moose Point taking stations on
the outer beach. M. shot a Tringa alpina and I
a Pectoral. Two Greater Yellow-legs alighted near us
and I shot at one at long range as it flew. M. then
stalked them &[and] shot one as they started.

  As it was getting dark a Short-eared Owl suddenly
glided past me within a few feet turning out over
the Lake then back over the beach where I shot it.
It flew like a great moth &[and] fell broken-winged
clicking its bill and making a snoring sound when
I picked it up. Saw a few Ducks but got no shots.
