At the present time the most promising of these new wild types, 
all of the species as they are known in cultivation, and various of 
the horticultural hybrids are being used in hybridizations and in 
selective breeding. In certain selections, and especially those for 
fulvous, red, and pink flower-colorings, as many as three genera- 
tions of progeny have been obtained. The seedlings already grown 
or now being grown total about 10,000. Several thousand of these 
are at Skylands, the estate of Mr. Clarence Lewis, whose support 
in providing space and care for growing seedlings has greatly pro- 
moted the progress of the work. 
It may be said that this collection of daylilies is being very fully 
utilized (1) for a taxonomic study of the various species, (2) for 
the experimental study of sterilities, (3) for cytological studies of 
the conditions and processes involved in sterilities and in fertiliza- 
tion, (4) for determining various aspects of heredity, and (5) in 
selective breeding for the development of new hybrids of merit as 
garden plants. The conditions in this group of plants are espe- 
cially favorable to this combination of interest and research. 
The matter of special concern in this report is that of the selec- 
tion of seedlings that are to be propagated and named as horticul- 
tural clons. A very critical judgment is being exercised in these 
selections and the opinions of various persons are considered in 
making final choice. There are hundreds of fine seedlings and if 
the number to choose from were small any one of many of them 
might well be propagated for the trade. The aim is, however, to 
select only those of outstanding merit, to avoid naming numerous 
seedlings that are almost identical, and to hold even very good 
seedlings for a time in the hope that still better ones of the same 
type or class may appear. And so each year only the very best 
of the seedlings are designated for special observation and for 
comparison. Some are used in further selective breeding. At the 
present time there are numerous seedlings with splendid shades 
of pink and sprightly red colorings that are decidedly new to hor- 
ticulture and worthy of general culture. But these are being held 
in reserve in the thought that plants equally good in color may be 
obtained which have larger and fuller flowers or somewhat better 
habits of growth. 
Brief mention may now be made of the four seedlings named.
