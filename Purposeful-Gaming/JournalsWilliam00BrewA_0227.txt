1890.
Sept. 22,
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
  Clear and cool with N.W. wind. Started with H. at 9
A.M. We first hunted for the Woodcock seen yesterday.
Don found him among birches and made a beautiful point. I 
flushed the bird and Henshaw shot it.

  We next beat the covers towards and around the Brown
farm seeing nothing but a very shy Partridge. The ground
to the westward around Sweat's proved equally disappoint-
ing and we came in at noon with only the one bird.
  After dinner we drove to the bridge over the Swift
Cambridge on the Andover road and beat the hillsides
covered with brakes & pasture spruces where I killed some
Woodcock two years ago. Started five birds of which we
each bagged one. Don behaved very well but made only two
good points. Most of the birds were among the brakes and,
as is usually the case on such ground, they ran a good deal
and gave the dog much trouble to overtake and find them.
  Saw a good many Sparrows and one Pigeon Hawk. The
Warblers seem to have all left. Flickers are numerous but
we neither see nor hear many Jays, and Robins are scarce.

  The asters are in full bloom but the golden rods are 
mostly out of flower. Actea alba is conspicous in damp
places by the roadside.
