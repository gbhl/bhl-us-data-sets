1889
Oct. 11
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Cloudy all day with a glorious flood of sunlight
just before sunset. Wind N.W. moderate. No rain to-day.
  Started off alone in the Rushton canoe at about 
10 a.m. taking the 20 gauge. Went first to Leonard's
Pond where I shot a Canada Jay and a Flicker.
Very few small birds, one or two Song Sparrows, several
Swamp Sparrows, and some Robins.

  Thence paddled out past Moose Point and
setting sail sped swiftly across to Sturdevant's Cove.
On the way a Velvet Scoter passed me within long 
range but I did not fire.

  Landed at Sturdevant Cove, built a fire and 
lunched among some tall timber on the edge of
the burnt ground. A Winter Wren and two Olive- 
backed Thrushes came to inspect me hopping around
very near. Kinglets and a Hairy Woodpecker in the
trees overhead. Suddenly four Sheldrake appeared 
swimming close in shore within 20 ft. of my 
canoe. I shot one in the water and wounded
another badly as it rose but the latter got off.
Started back at about 4 p.m. paddling up along
the shore to Crocker's Camping ground. To my
surprise saw a small Tern (presumably a Wilson's) 
flying out over the Lake. Shot another Canada
Jay from the canoe.

  Setting sail again I ran swiftly and
comfortably down to Moll's Rock, the wind
coming strong & steady from the N.W. with
very little sea running. As I was passing the 
the Rock Mr. Noyes called me in and showed
me a fine Canada Goose which he shot this
morning in Bottle Brook Pond.
