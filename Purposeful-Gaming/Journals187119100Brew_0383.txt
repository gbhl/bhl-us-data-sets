(Oct.15)
turnip field. It was alive with Sparrows and I
fired at one that looked like a P. princeps when
a large bevy of Quail rose behind me. I turned
and killed a fine cock with my remaining barrel.
I also flushed among the turnips and shot down
a small Warbler that looked like Hol. celata. I was
unable to find it, however.
  Entering the park we searched the dense scrub for
the Quail. H. got three shots at them bagging one
He also saw a Pigeon Hawk. I found the remains of a
cock Pheasant that had been probably killed by a fox.
  Taking the carriage again we drove around the park
starting several deer that dashed madly through the
scrub their white tails flashing as they bounded over 
the low scrub. Outside we did some more collecting.
I shot three D.p. hypochrysia, a Swamp Sparrow, and
four Pine Linnets the latter killed at one shot fired into
a flock. The outlying pines and thickets of scrub  were
fairly alive with birds, chiefly D. coronata each large
flock of which contained two or three D.hypochrysia.
  Henshaw ranged about on the east side bringing
in a Marsh Wren (C.palustris) and several common
birds.
  It was evident that an enormous flight of small
birds, chiefly Warblers and Sparrows, settled on the island
early this morning. All day long the face of the
country was alive with them.  They were very restless flitting 
from tree to tree & thicket to thicket often taking long
flights in straggling flocks across the open moors but
some as far as I saw passing southward out over the
Sound. In addition to the species mentioned we saw
Bluebirds, Pine Warblers, A Parulla, Field & Chipping
Sparrows & many Grass Finches. W.B. [?] 1
