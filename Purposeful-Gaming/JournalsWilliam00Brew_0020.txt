(March 30)
pouring almost in a steady stream flock quickly
succeeding flock, some of the flocks numbering at
least 200 birds but the majority from 10 to 50 birds.

  Concealing ourselves I got several shots each, D.
killing two & I one bird. I was preparing my
specimen for wrapping when a rustle of wings attracted
my attention & looking up I saw a fine old [male]
Marsh Hawk within 20 yds. beating the air frantically
in his efforts to get out of range. In this he succeeded
for before I could raise & cock my gun he was 80
yards away.

  We did not explore the great sand-hills being obliged
to cut our stay short & return to get up river before
the tide ebbed too strongly. Passing the spot where
we shot the Owl D. flushed & shot a P. princeps
probably the same bird seen early in the day.
  On the way up river I made a long shot at a
Crow that attempted to pass over us.
  During the day he heard & saw Horned Larks
at interval, perhaps 15 in all, the largest flock
containing six birds only. All were flying north.

  At the station (where we just missed the 4 P. M. train
& had to wait until 6 P. M.) we found Bradford Torrey
and the Faxons (two brothers & their father). They had
spent the day on the great sand-hills where, near
the light-house, they saw about eight P. princeps &
heard what they took to be one singing a strain similar
to that of P. Savanna but louder. They could not find
this bird. They also saw 15-20 Horned Larks along
the beach among the drift & very tame. Also some
Snow Buntings.

  We saw two Herring Gulls & about 20 Ducks mostly M. serratus
& Bucephala americana. Some gunners had five Black Duck.
