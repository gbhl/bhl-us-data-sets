1889
Sept. 18
Cloudy with occasional light showers. Warm. Wind S.E. to N.W.
  Chadbourne arrived last night and with Spelman and him 
I started by steamer for our camp this morning. On the
way up the Lake saw five Sheldrakes and three Whistlers near
Bear Island. Also a few Eagles and a Loon or two.

  Upon reaching camp Sargent told me that he saw nine
Canada Geese fly up the Lake towards Moose Point late yesterday
afternoon, the weather thick & rainy at the time. They flew
close to the surface of the water in a line.
  We spent most of the day getting our things arranged 
I skinning two of the Wood Ducks shot on the 16th.
Late in the afternoon we started for the Outlet, C. & S.
in one of the boats, I in the little Rob Roy. At the 
Outlet found three Winter Yellow-legs at which C. & S. both
fired as they flew past. They alighted on the beach
well up towards Moose Point. I went in pursuit, On
the way came upon a flock of fiver Ereunetes and one Sand[er]ling
feeding on the beach. Shot the Sandling and one Ereunetes which 
"got in the way". The Yellow-legs proved shy and flew over
across the river.

  I then went to Moose Point where I found the
Thurstins. C. & S. shortly afterwards joined us. They had
beaten a portion of the marsh and killed one Snipe of
which they started three. While we were talking a flock
of twelve Wood Ducks circled over the marsh & alighted 
in an open pond hole.

  I then left the others and paddled through Richardson's Carry 
starting a Snipe from the mud. Found the Yellow-legs on
the marsh and paddling to within about 60 yards, got all three
together and to my great surprise killed them all at one
shot from the choked barrel of the little 20 gauge.

  As I sailed out of the river after dark, heard Snipe
squeaking on every side. Also heard what I took to be an Upland Plover.
