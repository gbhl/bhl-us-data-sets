1887
May 21
Concord, Massachusetts.
Clear and warm. Wind N. E.
  After spending one day in the house and two
(19th and 20th May) attending to business matter at
Boston and Cambridge I got back to the woods
again this morning. The warm weather of the 
past two days(the temp rose to 90 degrees at Boston,
yesterday) has wrought great changes and I found
the woods already dense with foliage especially
when maples, briches and poplars found the chief
growth. The apple blossoms were nearly all gone,
the shad bushes past, and high bush blueberry and 
huckleberry bushes the most conspicuous flowering shrubs.
  I went to Estabrook woods and spent the 
morning there, beginning my tramp at the line
Kilu and evening the usual ground.
  Almost the first bird I saw and the very first one I 
shot was a Lincoln's Finch which rose from a ground
juniper on the edge of the run and took a small
dense pine.  I afterwards flushed and shot another
about 200 yds. worth of the line Kilu.
  In the run where I started in were several Canada
Flycatchers and d. Cacrulscurs, several Lanagus, and 
Grosbreaks, and a Wood Thrush. Near the high pine Knoll
I found a Blue Jay's nest from which the bird flew.
Supposing that it held eggs I shot the bird abut on
[?] to it I found it empty. In the swamp
beyond this knoll I heard a Myiarchus calling.
  On the southern border of Ash Swamp I heard a 
Golden-winged Warbler and after following him about
for sometime shot him. At the bend of the road
beyond the deserted Estabrook farm I heard and 
after a short chase, shot another of those Warblers
