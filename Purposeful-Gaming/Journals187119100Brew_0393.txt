south, out into a tussocky meadow, and finally 
across this and up a wet alder [?]. Near the head
of this he pointed staunchly and stepping in ahead 
of him I flushed the birds, about a dozen in number.
I apparently missed my first bird although the aim
seemed to be all right but the second fell wounded 
& was quickly caught & brought in by the dog. The bevy 
went off well together and settled in a dense swamp
where I could not follow them without wading
knee-deep in mud and water.
  I lunched on the edge of this swamp and afterwards 
started a Grouse on the hillside above. Although I 
remained here over an hour the Quail did not whistle
but at sunset while walking through Prospect St. I 
heard one of them calling. 
  During the afternoon I beat over a great deal of 
ground without seeing any signs of game birds. In 
a general way I followed the runs down to the 
Willows and there kept on a  southerly direction 
nearly to the Waverley mill-pond and back across the
hills to the east to Prospect St. where George met me
with the buggy at sunset. 
  Two Robins (one of which I shot) a few Tree Sparrows, and
a Meadow Lark were about the only small birds seen -
excepting some Chickadees. The Lark was on Rock Meadow,
a single bird apparently. I got within about sixty 
yards of him and shot at him as he rose. 
  Rock Meadow was glistening with spiders' webs - 
or rather strands - and many balloon spiders were 
drifting across it a few yards above the grass.
