40 CRUISE OF THE NEPTUNE 
This ice completely filled the side of the strait, and probably 
extended to Nottingham island, but there was open Water on the 
north side of the strait through which the Whaler Active had 
already passed on her Way into Hudson bay. The important 
point to be noted is that during all the times that the Neptune 
was beset by the ice during the passage east along the south side 
of the strait, there was never any sign of the surrounding ice 
rafting by the pressure occasioned at the change of tides, and 
never was the pressure about the ship sufficient to cause damage 
to an unprotected iron ship. 
There is little doubt that if a more northerly course had been 
taken on the passage eastward much more open Water would 
have been found, including an unobstructed passage from at 
least the Western end of Charles island, While to the westward 
open lanes would probably have extended from the neighbour- 
hood of Nottingham island. 
During the early part of July ships proceeding out of Hudson 
bay will probably find on the southern side of Hudson strait, 
or rather on the southern side of the mid-channel, the best and 
safest passage, owing to the easterly currents of that side. 
Ships entering Hudson bay at this time should follow the 
northern side of the strait, keeping as far as possible away from 
the land, especially that of Big island, until that island is 
passed, when the mid-channel should be held past Nottingham 
island, and from there the course should be laid to pass within 
easy distance of the north end of Mansfield island. The strong 
tides in the eastern part of the strait, and especially about Big 
island, cause the ice to close with considerable pressure at the 
change of tide, and this dangerous pressure is most severe close 
to the land.
