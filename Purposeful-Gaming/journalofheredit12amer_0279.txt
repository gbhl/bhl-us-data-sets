CRINKLY AND NORMAL MAIZE LEAVES 
The leaves of Crinkly are not only crinkled but often have prominent lobes near the base of 
the blades. These leaf characteristics are variable, however, and although it is usually easy to 
distinguish crinkly from normal plants, separation is occasionally somewhat difficult. (Fig. 25.)
