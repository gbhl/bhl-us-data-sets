Thursday, December 16, 1869.
  Clear and cold.
Ther. about 20[degrees] - 
35[degrees] - 30[degrees].
Rose as usual.
After breakfast rode
down to the Port
and went out on the
marsh where I found
H. Henshaw. After
getting some lunch
we went into Boston
together and I bought
a pound of powder
and a Horned Grebe.
After getting out had
the General harnessed
in the single sleigh
and riding up through
Waverley and Belmont
found a number
of cocoons, and
Henshaw shot a
Chickadee.
Friday, December 17, 1869.
  Clear and pleasant.
Ther. about 30[degrees] - 38[degrees] - 
30[degrees]. Rose as usual.
Spent the A.M.
in skinning the
birds left over from
Wednesday and
the Grebe; with the
latter I had a great
deal of trouble as he
was very bloody.
In P.M. took my
gun and Dart and
went up through
the Pine Swamp.
Took Parus Atri,
four; Certhia Amer.,
one; Picus Pufis,
one.
Got home in
time for dinner.
