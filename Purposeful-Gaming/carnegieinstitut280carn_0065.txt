SELECTION OF SUBJECTS. 47 
ment once and it was unnoticed, he would certainly repeat the offense. 
It is a great pleasure to record that there was no other instance in which 
there was even a suspicion of an infringement. We now believe that 
the apparent violation of the rules was due to a gross error in reading 
the volume of urine. As stated earlier, these men were all professing 
Christians, but the men either refused to take the sacrament at church 
or else took it and reported the fact in accordance with the agreement 
in the affidavit. Our own personal belief is that none of the 26 men 
wilfully infringed the rules at any time during the research. The 
number of instances in which the students reported minor violations of 
the rules were so rare as to lead us to believe that throughout the entire 
period the 26 men used in the research considered it to be a serious 
phase in their academic life and lived up to the high standards of the 
college. We place special emphasis upon this point, as it indicates that 
the selection of subjects from the college body of the International 
Y. M. C. A. College at Springfield, with the high ethical standards 
obtaining, the honor system, the unusual interest in and appreciation 
of physiological experimentation and the importance of service in the 
national food crisis, was particularly fortunate. 
PERSONAL HISTORIES. 
The brief personal history for the individual subjects which follows 
includes the full name, date of birth, home address, age at the beginning 
of the experiment, height, initial nude weight, and the result of the 
preliminary physical examination by Dr. Walter H. Chapin of Spring- 
field, Massachusetts. Under "personal data" are included various 
miscellaneous incidents during the progress of the experiment, more 
especially those relating to the physical condition of the subject. The 
physiCal characteristics of the family of the subject are given under 
''family history." The course taken in college and the physical 
activities of the subject are likewise included in the data. The per- 
sonal histories for Squad A are naturally more detailed than those for 
Squad B. For subsequent reference in a large number of tables, abbre- 
viations of the names of the subjects seemed essential. Consequently 
throughout the book, the men are usually designated by the first three 
letters of the surname in each case. The personal history of each man 
is given under this arbitrary designation for ready reference.
