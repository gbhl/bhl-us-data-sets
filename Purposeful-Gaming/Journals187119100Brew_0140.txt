1886
July 24
Drive from Concord to Groton via Tyngsborough
  Clear and warm. Wind S. W., strong.
  With Purdie started from Concord at 11 a.m.
and drove to Tyngsborough via Carlisle and 
Chelmsford, reaching Tyngsborough at 4 P.M.
The day was hot, the roads dusty. We saw
but few birds and heard still fewer. A 
Red-eye or two in the woods (our heard a 
curious whimsy voice and was not at first
recognizable) and now and then a Song Sparrow
by the roadside with the only youngsters.
At Tyngsborough I saw two Litta Carolincusis
both in shaded trees in the village.
  Leaving our house at the tavern we lived
a fresh air and drove to Parharm about them
whilst out of the the town. The country by the 
way was wild and chiefly in white pines and 
mixed woods. Parharm showed us nothing
of much interest.  He still finds saw-what Orios
nest. Had our [?]  three young last Spring (1886)
and in [1885-shot] March of them saw year shot
fifteen by calling them at night.
  Resuming our journey at 6 P.M. we drove
to Groton a distance of fourteen miles. The
road was hilly with interesting and occasionally
picturesque scurry; my few house and 
much woodland; Carlye pines. At sunset
only a few birds sang; a Henslow's Sparrow,
a Field Sparrow, a Towhee and a Grass Finch
or two. No thrushes of any species although
we had confidentiality expected the Hermit.
  Reached Groton at 8 P.M. The same hotel as
