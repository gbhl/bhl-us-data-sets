went to sleep again.
Began to write up the 
catalogue of my collection

"stuck" till 4 P.M. taking
lunch with us.
We played parlor croquet
most of the time and
also danced a good deal
getting the redoa step

Clear and a pleasant
day. Ther. about 20[degrees] - 
48[degrees] - 24[degrees]. Rose at 6.30
A.M. and started off
taking Billy. Went first
up to the pond and 
fired quite a fair shot
at a Bald Eagle but did not
fetch him. Then shot a Crossbill
in the Pine Swamp. Then
across into Watertown and
shot six Cedar Birds at a 
shot but only got four. Then shot 
two more. Then shot a Shore
Lark and got very near a male
Blue Bird, the first of
the season. Saw a Robin.
Got home at 12A.M. Then took 
my wagon & went after the Shore
Lark that I had hidden.
In P.M. stuffed him. In
the evening called to see J
Nichols & R. Deane.
