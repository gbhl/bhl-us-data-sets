pine woods. We each killed eight birds here.
I used one of C's guns and made wretched
shooting with it missing fully as many
birds as I killed. The triggers pulled too hard
and I regularl;y undershot my birds. Both
bevies were large ones. They ran more than
any Quail I have hitherto seen here and
did not lie at all well.
  Saw many Doves to-day and great numbers
of Chipping Sparrows and Grass Finches.
One Pine Warbler heard singing. Two
Grebes in a small pond. Shot a fine
adult Buteo alleni on the drive home.
He was sitting on a stub over a marsh
and I slipped out of the wagon and
stole up within good shot through some
dense scrub.
