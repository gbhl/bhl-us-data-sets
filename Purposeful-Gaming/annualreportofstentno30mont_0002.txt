To His Excellency 
Governor Sam C. Ford 
Helena, Montana 
My Dear Sir: 
I am submitting herewith the Thirtieth Report of the State Entomolo- 
gist of Montana. 
The work of this office has progressed on a fairly satisfactory basis 
during the past biennium. The demands on the office for assistance have 
grown and the personnel has shifted due to the present world-Wide condi- 
tions. During this period Mr. O. B. Hitchcock, Assistant State Entomologist, 
entered the armed forces, and from the spring of 1942 to March, 1944, it was 
necessary for the State Entomologist to do considerable field work in addi- 
tion to his regular duties. In March, 1944, we were fortunate in obtaining 
the services of Dr. J. A. Callenbach who has done an excellent piece of work 
in handling most of the field details during the past control season. Mr. J. 
F. Reinhardt, who has been the State Apiarist since 1941, has resigned 
effective DeCember 31 to accept a position in apicultural research in Georgia, 
and this leaves the position to be filled if these services are to be made 
available to the beekeepers of the State. Such changes are to be expected 
in these trying times with the present demand for trained personnel, and 
will make the administration of the work of this department difficult for 
some time to come. 
There has been a definite change in emphasis in grasshopper control 
during the past two years, in the shift of maximum utilization of bait from 
the early growing season to the fall in the winter wheat areas. In this con- 
nection this office has been cooperating with the United States Bureau of 
Entomology and Plant Quarantine in working out methods for large-scale 
marginal baiting programs which, in the fall, have proved successful in the 
protection of fall-planted crops and reductions in the number of eggs laid. 
It is felt that there will be a considerable increase in this type of control in 
the future if it continues to prove as successful as the programs in Yellow- 
stone and Sanders counties appear to have been in the past two years. 
Respectfully submitted 
HARLOW B. MILLS 
State Entomologist
