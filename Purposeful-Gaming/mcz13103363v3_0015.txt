1867
Friday, January 18.
  Clear but very windy. Snow
drifted all day. In A.M
they ran a 'twelve horse'
omnibus by here as the horse
cars could not run. In
A.M. went up to the Russell's,
the Paine's and the Deane's
but R. Deane had gone to
school. Our school did not
keep of course. In the A.M.
C. Carter fired at a shrike. In
A.M. fixed the feet on my coot.
Also went out and jumped
about in the drifts, At noon
went over to the river with C. Carter
& saw a gold finch and a meadow
lark. In P.M. painted the legs
and bill of my coot & R. Deane came
down.

  A.M. clear P.M. cloudy.
At 8 A.M. ther. at 0 [degrees], at 10 P.M.
8 below. In A.M. went up to
R. Deane's. He came down
with me and we went over
to the river and cut a branch
on which to place some of
my birds. Saw two snow
buntings, a tree sparrow, two
redpolls, and two goldfinches.
Brought my limb home, put
2 white-bellied nuthatches, 2 red bellies,
a brown creeper, 2 golden wings, a
hairy woodpecker, and two downies
on it. Went to ride in P.M. and
watched a shrike for some time.
The horse railroad runs now from
the square to the bridge. There is
only a single path for a sleigh down
Brattle St. Spit snow in P.M.
