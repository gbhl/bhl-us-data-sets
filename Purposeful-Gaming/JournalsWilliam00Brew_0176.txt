leaky dory in which at some risk we crossed the river to
the marsh on the Eastern R. R. side. As we landed a
Yellow-leg (T. melanoleuca) rose and circled around us
keeping jusy beyond gun range. On this marsh
failed to start any of the Finches but D. & C. found
two one of which they bagged. We saw a Cormorant
(P. dilophus) flying over the bay. Off the beach there
was the usual great bed of herring gulls. No Ducks
were observed.
  The salt marshes are very beautiful at this season,
when the grass has been left uncut. Its color varies
from russet to deep wine red. There is an Exquisetum, 
very abundant in places, of a brilliant coral color.
