84 CRUISE OF THE NEPTUNE 
in this year, each country returned to the other all places taken 
during the war, and retained those captured previously, thus 
leaving to the company the possession of Albany only. 
Affairs remained in this condition until the treaty of Utrecht, 
in 1713, when the French relinquished all claims to the terri- 
tory about Hudson bay. 
The first attempt at exploration inland was made by the 
hudson's Bay Company, in 1691, when Henry Kelsey, by order 
of the Governor at nelson, accompanied some Indians to the 
interior. From his diary, it would appear that he journeyed,

1720, fears were entertained for their safety, and orders were 
despatched by the next ship to send the Whalebone, John 
Scroggs, master, in search of them. The instructions reached 
Churchill too late to be acted upon that season, and Scroggs did

water and shoals along the coast, he managed to reach Marble 
island, where pieces of wreck were found, but they were con 
sidered of no importance by Scroggs, who returned withou 
continuing the search. Hopes were long entertained tha 
Knight had made his way to the Pacific, and it was not unti 
1767 that the fate of the expedition became known. That yea
