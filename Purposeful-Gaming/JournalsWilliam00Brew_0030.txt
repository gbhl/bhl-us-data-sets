swamp in the westerly side & crossed it shooting
several birds on the way. This swamp has changed
sadly since my last visit. The steam shovel has bitten
a wide slice from its eastern side and more than
half of the original swamp has been replaced by an
unsightly clay pit. The untouched portion is drained
nearly dry and fire has killed most of the button bushes
as well as much of the meadow grass. Dense and tall
weeds have sprung up everywhere and the place
has become a perfect paradise for seed eating birds.
It fairly swarmed with Sparrows to-day, chiefly Song
and Tree Sparrows. Of the latter I saw not less than
fifty. They were in full song and their wild, sweet,
plaintive notes were almost incessantly heard on every side.
  There were also many Pine Linnetts, one flock of
about twenty, several of five or six, & a few single birds.
No Fox Sparrows or Goldfinches and not a single Red wing.
  As I crossed the fields on my way homeward I
heard a Flicker laughing in the oak grove at the
foot of Vassal's Lane. What crowding memories of
days long past that sound invoked! days when
Meadow Larks whistled over the surrounding fields, when
Snipe sprang by dozens from the wet runs and hollows,
where Red-wings were singing on every scattered tree 
top. All are gone now from these fields but the
Flicker still calls from his favorite grove, his voice
scarce heard above the din of the English Sparrows.
How much longer will he stay?
  At the head of Sparks St. in Mr. Deane's evergreens
saw a Regulus satrapa and a Certhia. Winter birds
are staying late this spring. The Juncos nearly all
gone, however; saw only two to-day.
