1886
June 7
  Clear and cool; wind S.W. very strong all day.
I spent the morning on the Lime Kiln Road going
over my usual ground including ash swamp. The
especial object of my tram was to visit three nests
of D. pennsylanica, each of which contained two eggs
on May 31. and which were left for full sets. Today
I found two of them despoiled and the lining torn
out, probably by squirrels. The third had only the
original two eggs, on which the bird was still sitting,
and which, of course were nearly hatched.
  Of new nests, I found the second nest of one of
the pairs of Grosbeaks which I robbed on May 31, and
which contained one egg on which the male was sitting
today; a nest of the yellow-billed cuckoo containing
3 eggs far advanced but at different stages, and
one young bird a few days old; a Maryland yellow thrush
with one fresh egg, and several Cat birds with eggs.
  The flood tide of bird singing is past, and at
moontide the woods are after early silent. But in
early morning and late afternoon one may still hear
grand bursts of melody in the proper places.
