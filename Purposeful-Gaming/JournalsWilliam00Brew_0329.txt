1889
June 16
Wayland, Mass.
Clear, the heat tempered by a strong but steady S.W.
wind which lasted into the night.
  To Wayland by 1.15 P. M. train finding Torrey on
the ca[?]se and picking up Faxon at Waltham.
  On reaching Wayland we took rooms at the
hotel and then started out in search of a boat.
Sherman, the only man who lets boats, was away
but would return at four o'clock, his daughter said.
So we spent the next two hours waiting, lying
in the grass by the roadside under the shade
of an apple tree. it was very pleasant with the
soft June breeze blowing steadily to us from over
the meadows. Orioles flying a little in the orchard,
a Meadow Lark whistling in a mowing field, several
Marsh Wrens (C. palustris) singing in the tall grass along the
brook. A young Purple Finch calling tu-e incessantly.
  Finally Sherman came. He did not like to let boats
on Sunday but would make an exception in our case.
He thinks Black Ducks still breed in some numbers.
About eighteen years ago found a nest fully half a
mile from water on a hillside when he had cleared
the land the previous winter. The nest was under a 
prostrate, bushy tree top & held eleven eggs which hatched
a few days later. The old Duck sat closely.
  Embarking in scow-shaped boat, large & roomy but
neither fast nor easy to manage, we started down river.
It was very hot at first and we heard & saw but few
birds. A Ka-e just above the upper bridge & a Phebee near
it. Two Phebees about the next bridge but no nest visible.
Marsh Wrens occasionally singing in the tall grass along
the banks. Passing the second bridge we began to hear
