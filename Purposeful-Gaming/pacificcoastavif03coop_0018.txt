ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS. 
During the past nine years the Cooper Ornithological Club, through the activ- 
ity of its members, has greatly extended our knowledge of the local distribution 
of bird-life in California. It is to the accurate records of these observers, as much 
as to all previous field work combined, that we owe the mass of data now avail- 
able. It is the author's wish that the present brief resume may serve as a recog- 
nition of this initial period of activity, and set it off from one of much greater 
accomplishment sure to follow, for our field is far from exhausted. 
In the compilation of this check-list which is the result of two years' work 
on the part of the author, he has sought information from every possible source. 
Aside from published writings, he has not hesitated to seek for information direct- 
ly from many persons. Invariably he has received cordial assistance wherever 
solicited. 
I have in particular to acknowledge valuable help from Robert Ridgway of 
the National Museum in comparing specimens and looking up records. I am also 
indebted to Charles H. Gilbert of Stanford University for critical advice on points 
of nomenclature; to William R. Dudley and Walter K. Fisher of Stanford Univer- 
sity for information in regard to the extent of Life Zones and Faunal Areas, and to 
the latter also for looking up literature and comparing Specimens in Washington; 
to Leverett M. Loomis for the privilege of examining specimens and books in his 
charge at the caiifornia Academy of Sciences; and to F. S. Daggett, C. Barlow, 
J. mailliard, W. O. Emerson, E. Heller, M. P, Anderson and other Cooper Club 
members for specimens and help in many ways whenever asked.
