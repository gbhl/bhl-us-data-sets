deerskin, all very neatly applique. On the east side of Hudson 
bay the women wear breeches and boots very similar in cut to 
those of the men, but on the west coast they are quite dissimilar. 
There the breeches are very loose, and reach almost to the 
ankles, where they are gathered in. Between the knee and 
ankle they have a curious bag on the outer side of the leg, which 
is used for their feet when seated within the snow-houses, the 
footwear being removed and the feet withdrawn inside the 
breeches and thrust into these bags-a very comfortable plan. 
With such long and clumsy looking breeches, short shoes and 
socks must be worn. 
The women arrange their hair in different fashions, often 
attempting to follow those set by their more civilized sisters of 
the trading stations. For example, the prevailing fashion on 
the east side of Hudson bay is to wear the hair cut short, like 
that of the wife of the officer of the hudson's Bay Company at 
Great Whale river. About Cumberland gulf the hair is usually 
put up in a knot on the back of the head, and this is sometimes 
varied by small side knots over the ears. Among the Aivilliks 
and Kenipitus, the prevailing fashion is two rolled braids 
wound with string or ribbon, one over each ear. The hair when 
dressed for native state occasions is separated into two side 
locks, each of which is covered by a highly ornamented covering 
sewn with beads, and worn as long cylinders hanging down over 
the breasts. 
The children's clothing, when they wear any, is very similar 
to that of the grown people, except that the girls, until they are 
nearly mature, are not provided with tailed coats. Infants are 
carried perfectly naked in their mother's hoods until they are 
about two years old.
