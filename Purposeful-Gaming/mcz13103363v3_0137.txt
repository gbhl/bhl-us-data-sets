at recess as my side was
weak. Walked home slowly
on account of my side.
When I got home stuffed
on peaches. After dinner
fixed my osprey & put in his
eyes. Went to ride with father
late in P.M. through Belmont
& round the pond. Called in to
see C Carter after dark. Went
up to the Russell's in the evening.
