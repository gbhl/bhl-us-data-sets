properties, such as pleochroism, magnetic induction, and discontinuous 
phase transition, which can not be explained in this way. In short 
numerous physico-chemical researches have proved beyond doubt that 
fluid crystals are simple homogeneous phases of well defined chemical 
compounds. 
The lecture was accompanied by experiments and illustrated by a 
number of slides that made the speaker's meaning clear and his argument 
convincing.
