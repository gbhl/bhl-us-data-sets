(Oct. 10)
paddled to within about 60 yds. When they flew
I shot down three, one of which gave us a long chase. 
It made surprisingly protracted dives. There were nine
Velvet Scoters with this flock but they kept a little
to one side and beyond. The bulk of the large flock
seemed to be composed of females & young Oedenia americana
of which species there were certainly not over five or
six adult males in the entire lot. There were also a few
[female] [delete]and[/delete] or young. Surf Scoters among them for I heard
their croaking & quacking cries and Mr. Noyes shot two
which I examined, both young birds.

  The Velvet Scoters came back and alighted near
us but we tried in vain to paddle within range of
them.
  An hour later we discovered the large flock
of Butter-bills in the Tyler Cove & paddled to within about
50 yards when I shot down four getting them all. Two
young birds came back and alighted near one of the
wounded birds at which I fired several shots without
starting them. After I had killed him we paddled
to the other two & I killed one in the water & the other
as it rose.
  Next to Black Island Cove leaving the flock of Coots
behind us for I felt that we had killed enough.
At the mouth of the cove saw three Horned Grebes. No 
Black Ducks. Water too high. Lunched in a sheltered nook.
A Blue Jay & a Winter Wren came about.

  On the way back to camp had a long shot at
four Black Ducks which rose from the stubs. Missed
with both barrels. Saw a Red-eyed Vireo in some 
bushes over the water getting within a few yards of
him.
