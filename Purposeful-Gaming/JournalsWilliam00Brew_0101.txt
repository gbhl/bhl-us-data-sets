1888
Sept 5   
Lake Umbagog, Maine
Clear & cool with a high N.W. wind.
  Spent the morning beating the covers about                         
the Sargent clearing. At his very first cast                               
Don ran in on a Woodcock which went off                               
unseen by me but whistling shrilly. I searched                         
long and vainly for him. North of the road we
found only one more bird which Don pointed
twice & which I got at the second rise by a very
hard snap shot. I think I hit him the first
rise but not at all hard.

  On the edge of the hillside spruces south of
the road Don found & pointed another Cock
which I walked up going in ahead of the dog.
This bird was molting badly & did not
whistle but he went off like a bullet, nevertheless,
until my charge stopped him just as he
was disappearing.  In thin spruces "Don"
also roaded an old cock Grouse which
finally rose wild & got off unshot at.
  I saw few birds this morning, a Thrush
or two flying up ahead of the dog, several
Robins in a pasture, a Red-tailed Hawk
sitting of a stub & a few Warblers, Kinglets
etc.
  In the afternoon had a long sail on the
Lake. Saw no birds of any interest.
