wild, boisterous day decidedly chilly and disagreeable.

  With the first twilight of dawn we were awakened by an                           
exclamation from Duncan who heard the whistling of            
Ducks' wings passing over the tent, doubtless those of the                         
same flock of Black Ducks that passed down last evening.

  We breakfasted early and then did some ignominuous                         
bait fishing in the pool below the dam I getting five                                      
small trout and Jim seven.

  At 8.30 a.m. Duncan and I started in he Graves                
boat for C. Pond.  For the first mile from the sluice, we had dead and
fairly deep water.  The  sluggish river winding about through
shaggy, stub besprinkled meadows covered with coarse grass,
often nearly doubling on its self after the wheat fashion of
Maine streams.  After this the water became rapid and
shallow in places, in others settling in deep pools with high, 
steep banks.  Over this shallows we had to drag the boat and
for two miles or more there was more walking than paddling.
As we proceeded the meadows narrowed and finally the
woods crowded closely on the stream leaving a belt of tall
alders in most places along its banks.  Through this stretch
- at least a mile before we came to the pond - the work
of getting the boat along was very exhausting but 
we persevered and finally came out at the pond, a
beautiful sheet of water about a mile long with C. bluff 
rising abruptly near the northern end and equally
high but were rounded mountains encompassing the
other side save to the westward when the outlet led
away through a comparatively level stretch covered with
arbor vitae and balsams.The forests on the mountain
sides were every possible shades of crimsons and gold,
about the edges of the pond the living trees came.
