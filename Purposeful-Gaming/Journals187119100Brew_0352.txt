1887
Sept 10        
MAINE, (L. Umbagog.)
Clear with cool N.W. wind blowing hard all the morning.
  Spent the morning sailing on The Lake in the little 
Rushton. The wind was strong and gusty, the Lake white-
capped. It was exciting sport.

  Running into the mouth of the Cambridge I discovered
a Yellow-leg sitting on a mud bank in one of the 
ponds. Lowering sail I paddled to within good
range and shot him. He seemed to be in a 
drowsy mood sitting perfectly motionless with
head drawn in.
  In the afternoon took Don in my Graves boat
and sailed down to Ryerson's pond where I landed
and beat the Lake House hill for Woodcock. Ryerson
has cut all the pasture spruces since last year but
on the edge of the ask swamp Don flushed a
cock which alighted within twenty yards. The dog
then advanced and made a fine point. I flushed
the bird but missed it. We could not find it
again.

  Returning to the pond I paddled out and took
a station on the river bank to wait for the
twilight flight of Ducks. Shortly after sunset a
Black Duck came directly towards me but I rose
 to shoot before it was near enough and got only
a long and fruitless cross shot. Two others passed
wide of me. All three alighted in the pond left by the
floating island. Two of them came into the big pond
after it was nearly dark and alighting withing about
80 yds. of me quacked long and loudly. One had a
cracked voice. Swamp Sparrows singing at sunset. A
Snipe calling hoarsely in the twilight & afterwards skimming
close overhead. One or two Herons (A. [?] flying about
