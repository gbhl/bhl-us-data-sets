1887
April 6
Belmont, Massachusetts.
  Clear and cold with a high N. W. wind roaring
through the woods all day.
  Off with Chadbourne in the morning driving
to Prospect Lt. and going over the usual ground
there with some additional territory not often
included. In the larger cedar and yellow pine grove
near the fork of the road found Fox Sparrows,
Juncos and a flock of Chickadees with a single
Litta canadenses accompanying the latter. Flushed
a Grouse near the storm wall on the north side.
Crossing the road and penetrating through the 
cedars on the South Side we visited the orchard
to look in the Owl-hole which proved empty.
As we leaped over the wall two Grouse rose
together at the foot of an apple tree, giving us,
had it been open season, a firm double shot in
the open.
  To the eastward of these cedars we came upon
an old field which was alive with birds. There
must have been at least fifty Juncos, nearly 
as many Red-wings and Cow Birds, several
Blue birds, and some Robins.
  In a swamp below were several Fox Sparrows
and here I heard a male sing repeatedly. He
was not at his best however.
  Returning to the fork of the roads C. saw four
Black ducks circle over the woods and apparently
drop into a small rain-water pond to the
north. We went in search of them but did
not find them. I however, flushed a Woodcock
from some wild rose bushes in the middle
