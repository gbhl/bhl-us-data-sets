Lake Umbagog, Maine
1886
Ereunetes on the mud bar at the mouth. Shot them all. 
Thence to Moose Point, seeing nothing. Met two members 
of the Noyes party. They had a pair of Spruce Grouse and a 
Squatorola in their canoe.

  Returned by way of Glasgow and B Brook coves.
in the former started six Black Ducks. In the latter fired
a long shot at a Sheldrake and killed a Perisoreus. Mel-
vin waited at the point outside. Just before I joined him 
he discovered a flock of about twenty Old Squaws in the Lake
and Luman paddled out to them. He shot down four and 
got three after shooting them all over again. The flock 
settled in again near the outlet and Alva paddled me to 
within thirty yards of them. I shot two sitting, both old 
males, and missed with my second barrel, but got in another
shell in time to catch a third bird as it rose. There were 
four adult males in the flock and we shot down all of them,
two each. I afterwards shot a Red-necked Grebe at fully
seventy-five yards with No. 8 shot.

October 18. Clear and cool with a rather strong north-west 
wind, and rain. 
  Our trip to-day was up around Great Island.
First saw three Whistlers in the pong near the Lake house.
Sent Alva in to drive them out and lay concealed near the 
outlet, I on the south side. They came directly over me, 
but rather too high up. I shot both barrels and hit my
first bird hard. We afterwards found him at the mouth of 
the river and Melvin shot him as he rose from the water.
