1886
July 25
Concord, Massachusetts.
  In the afternoon rowed up river with Purdie
as far as Nine Acre Common bridge and sailed
back. The Henslow's Sparrow was singing in
the meadow opposite Hubbard's farm.
  Swallow's were rather numerous along
the river and Bobolinks chirping and 
flying about in small flocks.
  On the hill above the shell band
 I heard twice and distantly the note
of a Field Plover.
  While passing the Finch's landing on
our way up river a pair of Quail rose 
from the east bank and flew across
the river.  I took them for Larks at 
first and their flight was certainly 
nearly swifter. The males was whistling
as we passed on the way back.
