same spot and looked off over the woods, villages
and distant hills that made the view to the south.
This view has changed very little in all these years.
The ugly hotel, to be sure, mars the foreground sadly
and the asparagus bed and orchard at the foot of
the hills are gone, but otherwise it is much the same;
the pitch pine woods beyond the brook, the snow covered
hills beyond, puffs of steam from the railroad &
distant factories rising in the still air and the general
effect of peace and seclusion. I heard a Flicker
calling below me.
  Finished my morning with a tramp through
the Arsenal woods. No birds save a Chickadee or two
and a second Flicker but very many squirrel
tracks (red squirrels, all of them) and one of the
squirrels snickering somewhere in the oaks.
  Chadbourne saw a large flock of Crossbills in these
woods on July 31st. I do not understand what
attracted them for there are no cones on the
pitch pines. There are also no cedar berries so
the prospect is poor for Robins and Cedar birds
this year.
  English Sparrows were scattered about everywhere
over the ground to-day.

  Before starting this morning I saw two Juncos
in the street in front of my house. Doubtless there
is already a slight influx of migrants that have
been wintering further south. Certainly I have seen
no Juncos in Cambridge since November and three
Creepers is a larger number than I should have
been likely to find in the Watertown wood in
January.
