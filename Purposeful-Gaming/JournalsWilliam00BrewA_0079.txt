1890
April 1
End of Florida trip.
Cloudless and warm with a pleasant breeze.
  Spent the day in packing and made no observations
of interest. The steamer came down at about 8 P.M.
and we quickly got our things on board and 
started for Cedar Keys which we reached at 11 P.M.
This practically ended our trip.
April 2 1890
Cloudy and warm.
  Left Cedar Keys at 8.30 a.m. and reached
Gainesville at 3 P.M. At the Keys saw a saw a flock of
twenty-seven White Pelicans flying in a long line
through the channel between the islands. They flapped
and sailed alternately in he usual manner
and (this I have not seen before) undulations
were continually passing down the line as 
the leader rose and lowered his flight and
each bird followed him. They were flying
at a height of about 40 ft.
  As the train passed over the marshes inland
we saw a good many Gulls, all apparently 
L. Atricilla and a few Green Herons but no
blue or white Herons.
(I left Gainesville on the morning of the 3rd
spent that night at Jacksonville, reached
Charleston on the evening of the 4th, started
for Washington on the afternoon of the 6th
reached New York on the 10th and Cambridge 
on the afternoon of the 12th)
