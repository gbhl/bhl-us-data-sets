16 ILLINOIS ACADEMY OF SCIENCE 
Mr. Hankinson has continued his observations of the fishes 
of the streams of his neighborhood, especially with reference 
to their breeding dates and habitats. 
Dr. Shelford has continued his extremely interesting and 
important experimental studies on the reactions of fishes to 
certain features of their environment, analyzed and isolated 
by means of an ingenious apparatus which he has devised. 
His most recent work has been upon the effects of the wastes 
of gas plants upon the fishes of a stream, a subject which he 
is to treat in a paper on our present program. 
It will be seen that our original committee on an ecological 
survey has itself virtually become the agents of such a survey, 
so far as this is practicable under our present conditions; and 
it is our intention to annex to our membership all active work- 
ers in this field, and to plan as we go methods of co-operative 
organization which will give a unity to our undertakings not 
possible in the beginning. Respectfully submitted, 
S. A. FORBES, Chairman.
