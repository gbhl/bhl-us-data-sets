Cadillac, Michigan
Cloudy & cold; wind N.W. About 2 inches of snow fell last night.
  To Cummer's camps at 9.30 having the wagon return for us at
1.30 P.M. On the drive out we saw less than a dozen birds, mostly
Sparrows & Juncos. Returning passed a Tanager which was several
hundred yards from the woods, among stumps alighting on the
ground. He looked chilled and half-starved as well he might for
it froze hard last night and snowed at intervals through the morning.
  Upon reaching our ground we separated Dwight taking
to the woods while I penetrated into the open burnt lands.
I found there several mixed flocks of Warblers & Sparrows
feeding on the ground among the stumps and logs.
In one there were several Grass Finches and a D. palmarum;
in another about twenty D. palmarum, two D. tigrina,
several Grass Finches, and a Chipping Sparrow; in a
third two D. galinarum and a D. blackburniae besides
some Grass Finches. It was interesting to see the
Wood Warblers in such company & surroundings. I shot
both the D. tigrina on the ground.
  In this open land I found a nest of Picus villoms
in a beach stub not over ten feet above the ground.
The [female] entered and emerged from it. I shot her and in
dissection found that she had laid all but one or 
two eggs. There were chips scattered over the ground under
the nest over a space of a rod square.
  Late in the forenoon I entered the heavy timber
where I shot on the 12th. These woods were silent
and nearly deserted to-day. I found one small
flock of Warblers, however, containing several D. [?],
2 D. caerulescens, several D. virens and a Mniotilta
varia.
  Hearing a Grouse drum I crept silently towards the
