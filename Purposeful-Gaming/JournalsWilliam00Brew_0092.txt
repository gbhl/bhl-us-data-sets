we found the nest of a flying squirrel. The [female] came
running out when Bailey shook the branched and
sailing down struck at the foot of a spruce running 
quickly up, keeping on the further side but peeping
around the trunk at us every time she stopped.
Her nest was a round ball of strips of fine, [?]
bark, about as large as one's head . It was built on
a horozontal branch of a spruce 20 ft. up & 8 ft. out.
It was empty so I shot the owner for a specimen.

  After another straight-away tramp over a stiff ridge
and across a swamp through which flowed a large brook
we came to the base of a steep and very picturesque
hill heavily timbered with old growth hemlocks & spruces.
Along its base were several huge moss grown boulders &
some fine ledges covered with rock ferns. The trees were
fairly alive with birds among which I quickly distin-
guished by their songs Vireo solitarius, Dendroica coronata,
D. virens, D. blackburniae, Parula amer., Regulus satrapa,
Hel. rufricapilla, Junco hyemalis, and Carpodacus purpureus.
Hermit Thrushes and Robins were also numerous here.
In the swamp below a Tanager and Canada Warbler
were singing.
  The Kinglets were a pair the [male] singing in an undertone, the
[female] gathering material for her nest. We watched them for nearly
an hour but could not discover the nest although the [male] must
have gone to it several times. She was very quick in her
movements and it was difficult to keep sight of her without
following her too closely. I saw her go twice into a spruce
& thought she had the nest there but D. climbed the tree
& examined every branch without discovering anything.
If the nest really is in this spruce the [female] went only to the next
tree (a hemlock) for her material.
