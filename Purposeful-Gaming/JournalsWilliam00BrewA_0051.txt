1890
March 16
Banana Creek, Florida 1890
Clear and cold with a raging N. to N.W. wind all day.
I had intended to start for Titusville this 
morning but none of the boatmen would go. So
I spent the day in the house. Early in the
afternoon saw a Pigeon Hawk hovering over the
palmetto scrub. It hung suspended on motionless
wings breasting the wind for a minute or more
at a time precisely in the manner of [?]
Then it would close its wings descend like
an arrow nearly to the ground and shoot up 
again to its former elevation (about 30 ft.) without
flapping.
  Just before sunset I persuaded Robert a
mulatto boy to start for Titusville in a sail-boat
Mr. Reed going with us. The wind had begun
to decrease and when we reached [?] it
fell dead calm. Reed and I crawled into the
little cabin and Robert poled hour after hour. 
On reaching Indian River we got a fairly
strong wind and reached Titusville just as
day was breaking. The night was clear and 
very cold. I heard Coots and Widgeon all 
night long the former talking & plashing, the 
latter whistling. No other night sounds.
  Very curiously I have not heard a frog
of any kind during my stay at Mr. Cory's
Last year the marshes were alive with their 
voices every warm night.
