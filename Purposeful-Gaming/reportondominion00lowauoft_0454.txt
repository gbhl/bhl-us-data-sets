328 cruise OF THE NEPTUNE 
As the want of septa in the Cape Chidley specimens may be due 
to imperfect fossilization, Labyrinthites is, on account of its mode 
of growth, provisionally classed with the halysitidoe. 
Labyrinthites chidlensis. Sp. nov. 
Corallum massive, composed of slender, straight, upright coral- 
lites with numerous interspaces. Corallites a little less than '33 mm. 
in average diameter, quadrangular or five or six sides in transverse 
outline, with rather thick walls. Each corallite coalesces along its 
entire length with two or three adjacent ones, giving rise to a mean- 
dering succession of tubes inclosing narrow spaces not wider than the 
corallites themselves. In the specimens examined the corallites reach 
a maximum length of -30 mm. In longitudinal sections tabulae, in the 
form of thin, flat, transverse plates across the corallites, are observed, 
between -5 and 1.5 mm. apart. There are no tubules between con- 
tiguous corallites, and the mural union appears to be complete. 
Dr. Ami, who is studying the groups of fossils, other than the 
corals, obtained by Mr. Low at Cape Chidley, informs me that the 
majority of the Cape Chidley fossils are referable to the Ordovician, 
whilst two specimens are of Slurian age. The lithological character 
of the rock in which the coral is preserved appears to more nearly 
approach that of the Ordovician specimens.
