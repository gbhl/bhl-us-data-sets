me at least 70 yds. away and I killed one perfectly
dead; a wonderfully long shot for a 20 gauge gun.
  We then rowed into the outlet and tried the
Snipe marsh. M. flushed and killed a Pectoral.
I started a pair of Black Ducks at about 80 yds.
& foolishly shot two charges of #10 at them of course
fruitlessly. We found eight Snipe of which I shot
three and M two. One bird that escaped us
rose high and was flying in a great circle after
the usual fashion of Snipe when a Pigeon Hawk
appeared and pursued it for a minute or
more. It easily overtook but seemed unable to
catch it although the Snipe did not double more
than they usually do. Several times the Hawk closed
in on it and for an instant the two birds seemed
merged into one.  Once the Hawk shot directly
under the Snipe and turning sharply upward
seemed to attempt to strike it from beneath but
failed in this also. Finally the Snipe pitched
down into the grass and the little Falcon
kept on and gave up the chase.

  Saw a fine adult Marsh Hawk beating over the
meadow. Also a small flock of Phildrake.

  At sunset took stations for Ducks, M. near
the mouth of the river, I at a small pond in
the marsh. No Ducks came near me but I
heard several Snipe. M. got one long shot. I
saw two flocks of seven Black Ducks flying
high towards Moose Point.
