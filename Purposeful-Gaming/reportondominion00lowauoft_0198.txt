remainder of this northern coast between Admiralty inlet and 
Prince Regent inlet is formed of flat-bedded limestone, and 
rises in steep cliffs about a thousand feet high to a compara- 
tively flat plateau. This plateau with its cliffs continues down 
the east side of Prince Regent inlet nearly to Fury and Hecla 
strait, the land gradually becoming lower towards the south. 
The eastern side of Fox channel is as yet unexplored, and all 
information concerning it has been obtained from the Eskimos. 
They describe the coast as generally low, and much the same in 
character as that of the limestone islands of hudson bay. The 
limestone country terminates some distance north of King cape, 
which marks the western limit of Hudson strait on its north 
side, and the coast is again formed of crystalline rock, with its 
characteristic broken outline and fringe of islands. The north- 
ern shores of Hudson strait along its western half although bold 
are not high, and the interior probably does not reach a general 
elevation of 1,000 feet. To the eastward of Big island the coast 
becomes higher, and the land rises slowly inland to elevations 
of 2,000 to 3,000 feet. 
The highlands to the northward of Cumberland gulf, along 
the east side of the island, appear to be covered with an ice-cap, 
from which glaciers flow down the valleys leading to the many 
bays on this coast. These glaciers are neither as heavy nor as 
active as those of the islands north of Lancaster sound, and only 
rarely do they project into the sea and discharge icebergs. The 
lower lands adjoining the coast are usually free of snow during 
the summer. The ice-cap, according to the natives, does not 
extend far inland, the interior being practically free of snow 
during the summer months. About Cumberland gulf and to 
the southward the highlands are partly snow-covered, but the 
patches are detached, and there are no glaciers sufficiently large 
to discharge into the sea. The Grinnell glacier is an ice-cap 
covering the summit of the highland between Frobisher bay and 
Hudson strait. It is said to discharge by one small glacier into
