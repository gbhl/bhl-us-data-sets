332 CRUISE OF THE NEPTUNE 
(d)-in a small piece of buff limestone: 
BRACHIOPODA. 
1. Small shell of the type of Glassia, possibly the same as the 
Glassia variabilis, (Whiteaves) from the Silurian of the 
Ekwan river district. 
2. rhynchospira, sp. or Retzia, sp. A finely ribbed shell, not suffi- 
ciently well-preserved to be identified with any degree of 
certainty. 
3. Conchidium, sp. a small and immature form of what appears to 
be the Conchidium decussatum, Whiteaves. 
GASTEROPODA. 
4. Murchisonia (Hormotoma), sp. indt. 
5. Loxonema, sp. An imperfect individual with seven whorls pre- 
served, having an apical angle of 10, and would require at 
least three more volutions to complete the shell at this stage. 
(e)-in impure limestone: 
stone : 
BRACHIOPODA. 
1. Strophomena (Rafinesquina) alternata, (Emmons) Conrad. 
Three valves of this species appear to be represented in this 
small slab of rock, and exhibit the characteristic sculpture 
and other surface characters. 
(f)-in cream-coloured dolomite: 
brachiopoda. 
1. camarotoechia, sp. possibly the same as the camarotoechia 
ekwanensis, Whiteaves. 
OSTRACODA. 
2. A very large Ostracod, which is not in a good state of preserva- 
tion, but which, from its size and general characters appears 
to be close to Isochilina grandis 
(g)-in a drab-coloured limestone. 
BRACHIOPODA. 
1. strophomena, sp. of the type of Strophomena euglypha, Sow- 
erby. The sculpture of this shell is very much like that of 
Strophomena (Rafinesquina') alternata, Conrad.
