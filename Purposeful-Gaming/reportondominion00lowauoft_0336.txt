224 CRUISE of THE NEPTUNE 
Bathurst island (latitude 75 30' n., longitude 102 
Bathurst island, Bedford bay (latitude 75 n., longitude 95 
50' (vesicular scoriaceous trap rocks were found here by 
m'clintock, though no such rocks are mentioned elsewhere in 
connection with the Carboniferous.) Cornwallis- island, 
McDougall bay. Silurian and Carboniferous fossils were found 
together at the last mentioned place.' 
Professor Haughton also notes that ' the sandstone of Byam- 
Martin island is of two kinds-one red, finely stratified, pass- 
ing into purple slate, and very like the sandstone of Cape 
Bunny, north Somerset, and some varieties of the red sandstone 
and slate found between Wolstenholm sound and Whale sound, 
West Greenland, latitude 77 n. The other sandstone of 
Byam-Martin island is a fine, pale-greenish, or rather grayish- 
yellow, and not distinguishable in hand specimens from the 
sandstone of Cape Hamilton, Baring island.' Parry also 
describes Byam-Martin island as essentially composed of sand- 
stone, with some granitic and feldspathic rocks, these last being 
probably erratics. 
Respecting the coal seams which have been discovered in the 
Arctic Archipelago, Professor Haughton further remarks : ' If 
the different points where coal was found be laid down on a 
map, we have, in order, proceeding from the southwest, Cape 
Hamilton, Baring island; Cape Dundas, Melville island, south; 
Bridgeport inlet and Skene bay, Melville island; Schomberg 
point, Graham-Moore bay, Bathurst island; a line joining all 
these points is the outcrop of the coal-beds of the south of Mel- 
ville island, and runs E.N.E. At all the localities above 
mentioned, and indeed in every place where coal is found, it 
was accompanied by the grayish-yellow and yellow sandstone, 
already described, and by nodules of clay-ironstone, passing into 
brown hematite, sometimes nodular and sometimes pisolitic in 
structure.'
