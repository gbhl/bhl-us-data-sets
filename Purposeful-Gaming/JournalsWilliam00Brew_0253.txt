1889
March 1
Enterprise, Florida
Cloudy and cool. Heavy showers in early morning.
  Started at 8 a.m. with Cory intending to hunt
the country between Orange City and Lake Helen.
We got only as far as the railroad station,
however, when the rain drove us back. We 
made a second start at ten and
stayed out the remainder of the day.
We did not go far but drove at random
through the woods beyond the de Bary
Place and about the Junction. In all
we found four bevies of Quail. Three of them
were found by a pointer called "Grover", a tall
currish brute we had taken out on trial.
He pointed the first bevy and two high birds
staunchly but after this ran in on two bevies
after making a short point.
  I killed five birds, C. bagging four. One bevy
acted very badly running a long distance before
the dogs & rising out of range. We followed
them up sharply but they rose a second time
at fully 200 y[ar]ds distance. Mr. Cozzens tells
me they act in this way frequently after
March 1st.
  He saw very few small birds to-day,
nothing of interest except a Red-tailed Hawk
which came very near us. It was an adult
but it looked no larger than a B. lineatus.
