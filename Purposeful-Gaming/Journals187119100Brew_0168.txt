1886
Aug. 12
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and hot. Wind W., strong, Light thunder-shower
about 4 P.M.
  After breakfast I had Martin row the Rushton boat to
Nine Acre bridge where I met him, driving across by land,
thus saving myself about 4 miles row at the beginning of 
what promised to be a hard day. Taking the boat at
this bridge. I sailed to and across Fairhaven and nearly
to Lee's bridge. The morning was delightful but I missed
the bird songs sadly hearing nothing but a Cuckoo or two
and one Field Sparrow as I crossed Fairhaven. In the 
meadow at the inlet to the baby of Marsh Manse (C. stellaris)
was singing and I at once landed there and soon
flushed it. It took to the button bushes when I shot it
but it probably fell wounded for I could not find it.

  The Red-tailed at  Lee's Cliff was soaring high in air
screaming incessantly as I passed. At the mouth of 
Pantry Brook another behaved in a precisely similar
manner but kept lower down frequently alliterating and 
following us about. Both birds doubtless had young.

    On the Pantry Brook meadow I heard my second
Marsh Wren but I could not shoot these the meadow
was covered with cows and horses, haying. So after
poking the boat up the the brook for a quarter of a mile
I kept on up river. Just beyond the camps I heard a
third C. Stellaris and landing shot it. The a shower 
came up and I barely got to Sherman's bridge in time
to escape a wetting.

  After the rain came out again I started back. A 
shot which I fired at a Swallow started up
numerous Rails in the reeds along shore and for a 
moment there were dozens calling on every side but
