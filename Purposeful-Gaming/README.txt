BACKGROUND

These data files are the corrected OCR for books that are part of the BHL collection.
They were produced by the Purposeful Gaming project 
(https://biodivlib.wikispaces.com/Purposeful+Gaming).


FILE FORMAT

Each data file is a simple text file containing the corrected OCR for a single page.
The name of the file identifies the page within BHL to which the corrected OCR 
corresponds.

Here is how to find the appropriate BHL page.  Each file is named using the following
convention...

	<INTERNET_ARCHIVE_IDENTIFIER>_<LEAF_NUMBER>.txt

... where INTERNET_ARCHIVE_IDENTIFIER identifies the BHL item, and LEAF_NUMBER 
identifies the page (leaf).  Note that the leaf number is not the page number.
This example shows how to identify the leaf:

	Page		Leaf
	Cover		1
	Blank		2
	Title		3
	Blank		4
	Page 2		5
	Page 3		6
	Page 4		7
	Page 5		8
	Blank		9
	Cover		10

	
Consider the file with the following name:

	annualceremonyof08lint_0011

The contents of this file coorespond to the 11th leaf of the book found at
https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/ia/annualceremonyof08lint

Likewise, the file named:

	australianzoolog18191roya_0015
	
corresponds to the 15th leaf of the book found at 
https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/ia/australianzoolog18191roya_0015
