the sun and two or three long-legged beach
crabs which were as shy as those I remember
at Fernandina years ago running back into
the sand-hills before I could get within
a hundred yards. Their appearance is peculiar
when seen [there?]. They are so nearly the color
of the sand and move with such a swift 
gliding motion that one hardly feels sure
whether he saw an actual animal or some
shadow or bit of drifting foam.
  Foam, by the way, was continually blowing
up from the [belt?] where the waves rolled
in and in masses, varying from the size
of an apple to that of a child's head, drifted
back into the sand hills - producing a curious
and very beautiful effect, as the eye ranged
along the shore ahead it looked like masses
of drifting snow or, at times, like flocks 
of white birds running swiftly inland.
  I spent the afternoon in [skinning?] birds.
