melted as fast as it
fell. Ther. about 30[degrees] -

Rose a little early
and shaved and
read most of my
Greek lesson. Got
dismissed at recess
and on the way
home called in at
the velocipede riding
school and tried
one of them on a
fifteen minute ticket
but could do nothing at
it. In the P.M. came

having to wait for some
time rode for half-an-hour
getting the hang of it
quite credibly.
