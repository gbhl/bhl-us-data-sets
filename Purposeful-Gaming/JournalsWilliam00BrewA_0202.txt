Muskegat Island, Mass
but one or two out of the nest hiding in the grass where they were
very hard to see. There were dead young everywhere most of them 
in the down lying dried & shrivelled in the nests but a few nearly
full grown. I saw five in one little opening. What kills them?
There were a few eggs in places but not one twentieth of what
I saw during my last trip. There were also a few young
on wing, perhaps five or six seen in all. Doubtless there were
thousands of live young hidden among the grass & ivy. I
spent most of my time searching for young of the Roseate
Tern but do not think that I found one. At least I found
nothing that differed from young S. hirundo.
  Heard one Laughing Gull and saw an adult Sharp-tailed
Finch on beach grass on a dry part of the island. There
were a Meadow Lark & one or two Song Sparrows singing
near the house.
  The Terns were flying about all night long. During the 
afternoon saw many coming in from the sea with fish
but could not trace them often to their young. Saw one
hover over the grass near me with a small fish in its
bill, drop, & after a moment fly off without the fish. Went
to the spot and found a young Wilson's Tern nearly 
full grown. The Roseates were also bringing in fish
but I did not succeed in marking any of these down. 
July 31
Clear with a gale of wind from the S.W. in the afternoon.
  It looked so much like a storm in the early morning that 
we decided to start for home directly after breakfast. Got off
at 9. A.M. As we came around N.E. Point saw a flock of 9
Buff-head Plover circling & wheeling over the beach. Had a rather
light breeze across but as we neared Cape Pogue it began to
blow heavily. We had a wet time beating up the bay &
reached town at 1 P.M.
