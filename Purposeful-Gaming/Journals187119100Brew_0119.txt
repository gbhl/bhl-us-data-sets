Red-winged Blackbirds were almost as numerous as
in Great Meadow. I heard from or mix males singing
early in the afternoon and disturbed a large flock 
of young from the Phalaris grass opposite than Friends farm
on my return in the evening twilight.

  I [?] my few [?] rats of late, only one this
evening. I also saw a meadow monsi (Arvicola siparia)
swimming across the river and pursuing another 
I just as it reached the bank and disappeared
in the grass.

  White pond lilies still in full bloom living the 
near of the river with a broad bared of winter.
They close regularly at about noon all being tight
that at 12:30.
  Near the spring at Martha's Point I found a 
fine black ash, the only one I have met thus far
in the this vicinity. Its is a vigorous tree of [?]
seen and stand on rather high ground near a
brook.

  As  I was sailing about Fairhaven Bay as Cooper's  
Hawk's passed nearly over me, calling along in the 
usual swift, vary warmer, with two King Birds in 
close pursuit.

  Saw two broods of young King birds, each little
family sitting in a row on a branch over the water
huddled close together like young swallows. The old 
birds fed them at frequent intervals and both old
and young kept up a constant calling.
