that the bay could only be approached with safety by sending 
the launch ahead to sound. It was thought that too much pre- 
cious time would be lost in this undertaking, especially as it 
was known that a good harbour existed in the bay, where the 
Whaler Arctic had twice anchored, so we passed westward close 
to the land in order to correct the survey made during the night 
on the trip eastward. About thirty miles west of Deception bay 
the mouth of another long narrow inlet, known as Sugluk bay, 
was entered, and the ship continued five miles up it looking for 
a convenient place for water. A shallow place was crossed at the 
mouth of the bay, probably due to the ship being too close to 
the eastern shore, but, inside, the water was found to be very 
deep, and an anchorage could only be obtained on the edge of 
the narrow mud banks close under the rocky cliffs of both 
shores. 
In the small launch, the survey of the bay was continued to.

in a state of destitution. This was their first direct contact 
with white men; they were somewhat shy and frightened, but 
a present of tobacco and biscuit soon made all good friends. 
These people do not visit any of the far away trading posts, but 
trade their furs with their neighbours on the east or west for 
guns and other articles of civilization. 
Considerable difficulty was experienced returning against a 
very strong tide, and the ship was not reached until long after 
dark.

surveyed to Cape wolstenholme, where we arrived at dark; 
then the ship was headed north across the strait for Salisbury 
island, the eastern end of which was reached early next morn- 
ing. Following close along the steep rocky shores of the 
northern side, the northeast point was reached at noon. The
