holes.
  At length the wild country came to an end and as we
approached Saxonville we passed through semi-cultivated grounds
with patches of woods cleared of undergrowth, a rustic bridge
crossing the river and glimpses of houses and gardens threw[through]
the trees. Many birds singing here, Grosbeaks ???(Olivacus et 
?? flairfrons) Wilson's Thrushes etc. Horn???s (Carpinus) numerous
along the banks. Beds of wild geraniums under the trees.
  A glimpse at Saxonville with its factories &[and] shops was enough
and turning the boat we shot down stream for a mile or two
finally landing of the wooded bank and eating lunch with the
shade of some hemlocks. A Marsh Hawk beating about on the
meadow here was the only one seen during our entire trip.
  After lunch ran down to Herd's Pond which we entered and
crossed. After a nap in the boat under the shade of some
trees, where thousands of dragon flies had collected apparently to
gain shelter from the strong wind, we put the boat into a brook
through which we had been told, we could paddle to West Brook.
  It proved a hard task for the narrow channel although deep
enough was impeded by a perfect tangle of bushes and grape vines,
but at length we heard Marsh Wrens singing ahead and soon
emerged into West Brook meadow. Reaching the channel of this
deep but tortuous stream we paddled up it to E. Sudbury a distance
of about three miles. During this distance I heard by actual
count fifteen Short-Billed Marsh Wrens. For the first mile
they were side by side with even more numerous Long-bills
but after that the canary grass ceased and with its disappearance
we left the Long-bills behind. A big Bittern was ?primping in
this meadow all the time we were there &[and] we heard our Least
Bittern crowing as we returned. Near the mouth of the brook we 
also heard a Florida Gallinule
  After supper took a short walk. An superb moonlight night. Bull 
frogs, toads, ??? frogs &[and] green frogs very noisy.  On Carolina Rail ????
No Kir-wee and no Bitterns or Whipporwills
