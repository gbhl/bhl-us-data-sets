1890.
Sept 27.
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
  Cloudy and cool. Wind N. W. Jim came in the morning and row-
ed us over to the Lake House where I spent most of the day getting
my canoe in order. I also went up on the hill behind the Abbott 
place and hunted for Woodcock a little while starting one bird but
not getting a shot at him. Coming back down the river I saw five 
Pectoral Sandpipers circling over the meadows high in air and a
Marsh Hawk beating close to the grass.
