it down from on wing. A young cock with chestnut
ruffs. The second I shot on the ground. It stood
erect and still in the middle of the path 35 paces
from me. It was a superb old "drummer".
Many small birds along the path. Hermit Thrushes,
Titmice Kinglets etc. A Hylotomus in stubs near
our lunching place.
  Returned to Leonard's Pond late in p.m. Shot
a Flicker at long range. Then went to Moose Point
and lay concealed among the stubs until dark. 
Not a single Duck came in. The marsh is six
to eight feet under water.

  Saw five or six Canada Jays among the stubs 
in different places. Very tame & noisy. They seem to
haunt the vicinity of water.

Oct. 9
  Alternately cloudy & clear with gale from the W. Occasional light
showers.
  Off at 8 a.m. going up the Megalloway. A Black Duck in 
the river half a mile up. Landed at Bottle Brook Pond. A
Whistler and Hooded Merganser were the only two birds in the
pond. They swam all over it keeping close together, the Merganser 
diving, the whistler feeding with head and neck under water
like the one shot on the 5th. I followed them about for fully
two hours and finally stalked them killing the Merganser on
the water & bringing the Whistler down wing broken as it rose
by a very long shot. It dove twice & went ashore on the other
side of the pond. We took in the boat & I shot it once as it
crouched among the grass facing the water. Two Sparrow Hawks 
playing together on the pond. A Solitary Sandpiper on an
isolated lump of mud. also a Kingfisher. A flock of
fully 75 Pine Finches wheeling over the trees. After lunch
