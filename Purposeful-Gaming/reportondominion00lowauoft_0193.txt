ARCTIC ISLANDS 119 
low point with shallow water extending from it for several 
miles. 
Nottingham and Salisbury islands lie in the western entrance 
to Hudson strait. Their longer axis lies northwest and south- 
east. Nottingham is the more southward, and is about 
thirty-five miles long and averages about ten miles across. 
Salisbury lies to the northeast of Nottingham, and is separated 
from it by a deep channel about fifteen miles wide. The north- 
ern island is the larger, being nearly forty miles long and 
averaging fifteen miles across. Both are high and rugged, with 
a number of bays affording good harbours, especially at the 
southeast and northwest ends. The general altitude of these 
islands is nearly five hundred feet. 
The second division of the islands of Group i. includes the 
large island of Southampton, together with Coats, Mansfield 
and Akpatok islands. 
Southampton is situated in the northern part of Hudson bay, 
which it divides into Fox channel on its east side and Roes 
Welcome on the other side, being separated from the mainland 
at its north end by the narrow Frozen strait. The island attains 
its greatest length from north to south, covering three degrees 
of latitude, or a distance of two hundred and ten miles. Its 
greatest breadth of two hundred miles is across its southern 
part; its eastern side trends northwest, and its western shore 
lies north and south, so that the shape is practically a triangle, 
having an area of 19,100 square miles. The greater part of the 
island is occupied by flat-bedded limestone, causing the southern 
and western shores to be generally low and flat, with a margin 
of shallow water extending several miles from the land. Along 
the eastern side a band of crystalline rocks extends from Sea- 
horse point to the north end of the island, and this forms much 
higher land with bolder water adjoining than is found else- 
where.
