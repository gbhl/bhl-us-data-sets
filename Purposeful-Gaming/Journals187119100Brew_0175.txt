1886
(Aug. 16)
evening of the 14th. It comprised about as many
members as on that date with probably some changes.
The first bird I shot from it was a Nashville Warbler,
then next a beautiful young [male]Golden-wing. After
this I spent at least an hour without firing again,
but very profitably, watching the teeming bird life and
keeping a keen lookout for rarities. I soon found that
the bulk of the flock was composed of Chickadees & Red-eyes.
Besides these there were 5 or 6 Miniotilta varia, as many more
D. pennsylvanica, three D. [?], one ad. [maile] Setophaga, 3 or 4
Hel. ruficapilla,  two Picus pubescus, a pair [of] [male] Sitta carolinensis,
two Sitta canadensis, two Vireo flavifrons, and several
Wood Pewees. There was also certainly are ad. [mail] D. blackburnians
for I heard him sing once distinctly. The  Redstart
also sang freely as well as two ad. [male] Miniotilta varia.

  The young Cooper's Hawks were speaking in the pines
on top of the hill but I did not get a sight at them.
  After bagging a dozen or more specimens I started
for home. The wind had freshened and was blowing heavily,
the sky had clouded over and everything betokened a storm
(which broke about 8 P.M.). Not expecting to see anything
worth firing at I removed the cartridges from my pistol
and afterwards forgot that I had done so, a fatal error,
for while passing through the narrow reach just above
"Hunt's Pond" I came suddenly on a Prothonotary Warbler.
She flew from the overhanging brush under the bank and
alighted on a dead twig over the water within 6 yards of
me. I slowly drew the boat back to about 15 yds. took
careful aim and pulled trigger: snap! a sickening feeling
at the heart - a hurried insertion of a cartridge - too late
for the bird whirled off & disappeared down river where I 
hunted for her two hours in vain.
