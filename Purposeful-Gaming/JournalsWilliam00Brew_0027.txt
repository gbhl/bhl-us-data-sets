April 12
Concord, Massachusetts.
Morning clear and delightful with strong, but not cold, N.W. wind.
Cloudy all the afternoon with frequent light showers. A superb
sunset.
  To Concord with Denton by 8 a.m. train. Reaching
the Manse we launched my boat and paddling to

which were feeding near the outlet either saw or

within range. I then crept quietly into the pines hoping to
surprise the Red-tail on her nest. Taking a position
