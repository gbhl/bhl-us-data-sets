Having two hours left before dinner time I 
explored the country to the eastward, skirting a 
swamp when grew a number of fine larches;
crossing "Dugan's desert" a perfect desert as far
as birds were consumed;finding the blazing
star in bloom on the Lowell R.R. embankment;
and finishing by a tramp across Great Meadow
to their river bank when I saw a Sora and 
a Water Thrush. Except in Ripley's Swamp
the country seemed to be nearly devoid of birds.
This is curious considering their abundance 
yesterday and the exception ally heavy flight
noted last night.
  Within the past week the bushes have
become strongly tinged with yellow and some
trees are wholly turned; the ground beneath
them is everywhere spangled with fallen golden
leaves. A few read maples are also turning.
