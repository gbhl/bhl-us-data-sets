1889
January 31
Sanford, Florida.
Cloudy and mild with light S. W. wind.
  Spent last night at the Sanford House
and had almost two hours to wait this morning
before the steamer arrived to take us across to
Enterprise. All the birds recorded in my field
list under the above data were seen near the
hotel, most of them along the lake shore in
a belt of palmetos or about the garden. In these
palmettos were fully 75 Quiscalus major, very
noisy making the corn stalk fiddle cry and
flapping from tree to tree. Apparently they
make this place their rendezvous if they do
not breed in it.
  There were two Mocking birds and perhaps
a dozen yellow-rumps (D. coronata) in the garden,
the Mockers silent of course. A Titllark (Anthrus)
flew over the hotel several times and when 
we went down to take the steamer I saw
him alight on a shed near the end of
the long wharf.
