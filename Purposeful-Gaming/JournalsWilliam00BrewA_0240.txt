1890. 
Sept. 26.
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
  In this place we started at least seven Woodcock of which we
killed only three despite the fact that Don pointed nearly every
bird. The cover, however, was very dense and the birds flew like
bullets. There were also several Grouse here two of them old males
which drummed at frequent intervals. Two which we started were as
wild as our Mass. birds.

  Returning at noon to Ferrin's we ate our lunch on the sunny
side of his barn and then started out again climbing the hill be-
hind his house and going over the same ground covered on the 23rd.
We started nothing on the hill but in the valley beyond Don found
& pointed two Woodcock one among brakes & spruces the other in
alders on the bank of a brook. H. shot the first but the second
escaped us. I had a hard shot at it but missed. H. saw the bird
alight as he thought but we could not start it a second time.
Near the head of this valley we heard a grouse drumming and start-
ed another. It now began to rain heavily so we returned to the
house and drove back to Lakeside. On the way saw a Junco which
had the cheeks white and a few white feathers elsewhere in the
plumage. Flickers still rather numerous in the fields along the
road.
