After breakfast worked
awhile on the boat
with Dan & leathered
and painted both
sculling holes besides
piping the locker &c.
Then R. Deane called
and spent the A.M.
with us. After lunch
had Tiger harnessed
and took a sleigh ride
with Dan. Rode over to
the Milldam but as
the snow was very loose
& the sleighing poor
came home through Cambridge
Port. Saw a flock of
about fifty Snow Buntings

Grosbeaks.

In P.M. took a walk
nearly up to Watertown

They were scraping
the ice and had already
cleared a good portion
of it. Met R. Deane &
E. Dodge at 'the pond'.
