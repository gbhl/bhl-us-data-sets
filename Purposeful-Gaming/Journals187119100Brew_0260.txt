Great Island, Hyannis, Mass.
Cloudy with heavy rain all day; wind E., strong.
  We had planned to shoot Quail in the 
park this morning and as it was the last chance
we downed water proof smite and started in the 
pouring rain at about 8 a.m. C's dog, an old black
setter, worked beautifully but for some time in 
vain. Finally we flushed a small levy of Quail
and following them the dog found and prompted
them. They rose wild, however, and we failed to
get a shot.
 The dog next drew and pointed on the track
of a Pheasant which finally rose among some
pines and mounting high above the trees passed
us out of range making a lout outcry. It flew
nearly as fast as a Grouse and in a similar 
manner. Its lovey tail streaming out behind gave
it a curious appearance. I could see that it was 
a fine male bird.

  After this we hunted for nearly an hour without
seeing anything save a white hair, three does, 
and a large Hawk. One of the deer was startled by
the dog and came by us at full speed taking 
surprisingly high leaps but apparently not  going
a head very fast, certainly not nearly as fast as 
a horse can see.
  Returning past the dove-cotes we saw a 
berry of about Quail in the wood road. They
ran into the brush when the setter stood them
handsomely but they kept on running and would 
not lie. At length they rose and in both freed
but failed to kill any of them. We afterwards
