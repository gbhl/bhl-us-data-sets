June 24
Winchendon, Worcester Co., Mass
Clear and rather warm.
  To Winchendon by 3.40 P.M. train on Fitchburg R.R.
No marked change in the country until a little beyond
Fitchburg where the railroad (the Cheshire R.R.) begins to climb
to steep grade which rises very evenly all the way to
Ashburnham Junction. Near the beginning of this rise I began
to see Kalmia latifolia in abundance & in full bloom. Back
spruces and larches also began to appear and became
abundant a few miles further on. At Ashburnham spruces
and bolsams were growing in large tracts usually over
low wet bogs. From Ashburnham to Winchendon the woods
were of similar character.
  Reached Winchenden at 5.30. After tea drove about
the village and to the northward into the country a
mile or two. Beautiful, green, luxuriant woods carpeted
with ferns. Abies nigra, A. balsamifera, Betula lutea, et lenta, et
papyracea, et alba all abundant as were also hemlocks, white 
pines, red mapes, mountain do., striped do., larches etc. One
Viburnum lantanoides by the roadside.
  At sunset Robins, Hermit & Wilson's Thrushes, Grass Finches, 
Field Sparrows and a few other common birds singing. Hermits
abundant. In the town Robins, Chipping Sparrows, [?],
Chimney Swifts, Least Flycatches, and Kingbirds. Also the
hateful English Sparrows in large numbers. No Yellow Warblers.
  The country about Winchendon is hilly and rolling
broken in places by deep valleys - almost [?] between
the hills. It is largely wooded. The town is sixteen
miles (south) from Mt. Monadnock.   I was told that 
its elevation is "about 1100 ft.
