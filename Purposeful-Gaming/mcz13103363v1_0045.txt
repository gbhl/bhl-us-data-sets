Nov. 15, 1865 Chickadees and
brown creepers becoming
quite numerous the 
past week.

  Golden Crested Wren
 [margin]Nov. 18th,1865[/margin]
  They seem to be much more
numerous this autumn
than they generally are and
instead of being in pairs
as they appeared to be
generally last year they
are almost continually
around in groups of
a half a dozen or more.
They hop through the 
branches chasing some
unlucky insect and
after they have secured
it they renew their
search now and then 
uttering a rather feeble
cree-cree-cree, very much 
resembling the note of the
common brown creeper
but rather more
disjointed and feeble.
