many Swallows (Barn and Bank), two Night hawks,
and two Great Blue Herons. There were also a few
King Birds migrating, flying high in parties of 
four or five.
  At Ball's Hill a flock of thirteen birds, which
I at first thought be Passenger Pigeons,  but finally
decided with some doubt to call Caroline Doves,
passed overhead at a height of about 300 ft.
steering northward.
  The thickets and trees along the river were 
nearly dissected to-day but  I saw two Water Thrushes,
two Indigo Birds and a few Sparrows besides two
Creepers (Mniotilta) and a Phoebe.
  Upon reaching the great Luzania bed I 
found an enormous flock of Blackbirds going 
to roost then.  They conjugated in masses in the 
clusters of pickerel weed and made a great noise
chattering and gabbling. I was surprised to 
find that the majority were cow-buntings.
I shot two to make more of this.
  While here a pair of Upland Plow passed
high overhead whistling at frequent intervals
I reached home about 7:30.
  It is evident that the number of Warblers 
and other migrants in the woods has decreased
at least two-thirds written the past week. The
large mixed flocks have broken up and there
are few single birds. Probably the first great flight
has passed. I have heard few birds migrating
thus last four and five night although the 
weather has been fine.
