of ledge in the its middle in places when the 
water is two or three feet deep.
  Trapa vataus in bloom to-day, a single minute
white flower in the center of the chaster of leaves.
  The silky corned is still in flower everywhere
along the river banks; for a week or more

flowing thumbs.
  The meadow grasses and ledges are generally
in  bloom now and appear to have reached 
their full growth in most cases. The farmers
are laying everywhere on uplands fields and 
when the grass has been cut and removed
the stubble is brown and thirsty looking for 
them has been no rain for some time. The
country generally, however, is still green and 
pleasing to their eye in all the mid-summer 
luxuriance of floriage and vegetation.
