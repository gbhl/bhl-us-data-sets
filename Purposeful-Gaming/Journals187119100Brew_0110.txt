1886                     
July 2
Concord, Massachusetts.
Clear and warm; wind S.W.; light.     
  Spent the morning on the river                            
paddling and sailing down to Ball's Hill                 
and back.

  Just before starting heard a Nuthatch
(S. carolinensis) in the elms by the river bank.
The same bird was hauking in the trees
over the avenue yesterday.
  There were several broods of young                    
swallows (hirundo & bicolor) perched on dead    
branches over the river their parents feeding
them at frequent intervals.

  On the ridge between the river and
Great Meadow I found four or five pairs       
of Bobolinks perching on the tall stems
of Thalictrum all chirping anxiously, the
[male]s occasionally bursting in snatches of
song. Their young were evidently out;
indeed I flushed two from the long
grass both rising wild and taking
surprisingly long flights.

  Yellow Warblers and Song Sparrows were 
in full song all through the forenoon.              
Redwings also sang occasionally and I
also heard Field Sparrows & Oven Birds.
Orioles are now perfectly dumb and
with their young have disappeared from
the surface of bird life although doubtless
still here.

  In the afternoon while driving about             
town heard a Myriuchus on the Alcott place
