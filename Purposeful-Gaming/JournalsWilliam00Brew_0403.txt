him and then returned to the boat.
  In a pocket of the corn found a Hooded Merganser
& fired a wildly long shot at him as he hurtled past.
Several Sheldrake started at various places. Landed
at a pretty sheltered spot for lunch. "Squeaked" up [?]
flock of Titmice both species mixed. A ruby crowned
Kinglet & Sitta canadensis with them. Two Pine Grosbeaks
flitting among the alders, both brown birds.

  Came back down the Lake & tried the Old Squaws
again. No use They flew at fully 300 yards.Returned
to camp and I went out sailing in the little canoe
taking the 20 gauge (Damascus barrels). Heard a bird making
a noise like a Red-shouldered Hawk wher-o, wher-o, wher
o. Sailed towards the place when a large bird rose &
flew past me about 200 yards off. It flew like a Gannet
alternately flapping & sailing & finally plumped down into
the water in the middle of the water. it looked dark brown
& showed a conspicuous white speculum. Shortly after saw
another which made the same noise. I cannot even guess
what they can have been. They were larger than Loons.

both alike &

  Sailed over to Moon Point & took down the sail.
The sun had set but it was still daylight when, nearly
half a mile away, crowning the slender tip of a dead ash
on the shore of Leonard's Pond, I make out a Hawk Owl.
Paddled to within 20 feet of the foot of the stub and shot
my choked barrel at him. He flew & and my light barrel missed.
He went only about 100 yards & alighted near the top of another
dead tree. I landed again got nearly under him & again
shot the choked barrel. A handful of feathers floated down
but the bird scaled off across the pond my second barrel 
failing to stop him. I followed & started him again in
dense second growth getting a mere glympse at him. Disgusted
beyond words I returned to camp in the twilight
