1887
(April 7)
Concord, Massachusetts.
Manse to judge by the marks they have
left there, including several quarts of droppings
scattered about, most thickly on the
platform we had made last spring.
  We saw in all to-day just 29 species
of birds as follows: Robins, Chickadees, Nuthatches
(S. carolinensis), Bluebirds, Pine Warbler, Juncos,
Song Sparrow, Purple Finches, Goldfinches, Red-wings,
Rusty Blackbirds, Meadow Lark, Crows, Ospreys,
Red-tailed Hawk, Marsh Hawk, Pigeon Hawk,
White-bellied Swallows (only two), Turtle Doves, Quail,
Grouse, Great Blue Heron, Black Ducks, Gooseanders,
and Downy Woodpeckers. Curiously, we neither
heard nor saw either Phebees or Flickers.
  Most interesting were the birds of prey and
water-fowl. It was a good day for Hawks
and they were almost constantly in sight,
especially Marsh Harriers and Ospreys,
soaring high in air or scaling close over the
woods and fields. Of ducks we saw a great
many, probably not less than fifty Black
Ducks and nearly as many Sheldrake or
Gooseanders. The latter were mostly in pairs,
the drakes very conspicuous on the dark 
blue water as well as when flying. At a
distance they looked like cakes of snow floating
before the wind or with the current. Flying
their green-black heads were easily seen
at a considerable distance. They were very
shy, rising oftentimes nearly a mile
