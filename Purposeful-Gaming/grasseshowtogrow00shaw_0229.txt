MEADOW FESCUE. 205 
this grass based on American experience is very meagre. 
In meadows it is of less importance than in permanent 
pastures because of the comparative infrequency of the 
former. In permanent pastures in which it is desired to 
give this grass considerable prominence if the grazing is 
not close the heads which escape the grazing will pro- 
duce seed, which, when it falls down, will in due season 
germinate under many conditions and will in this way 
increase the grass in the pasture.
