ARCTIC ISLANDS 123 
a. fiord on the south side of Frobisher bay, but the ice from it 
rarely breaks off as icebergs. 
The northern land between Admiralty and Navy Board 
inlets is ice-covered, with glaciers filling its seaward valleys, 
and with the separating rocky ridges rising dark and forbidding 
from the general field of white. A thin ice-cap covers the 
northern part of the limestone plateau on the east side of Prince 
Regent inlet. 
The western interior of the northern half of Baffin island is 
described by the Eskimos as a rough plain, probably less than 
1,000 feet in elevation, diversified by rolling hills with 
numerous lakes in the valleys between. This country is well 
covered with an Arctic vegetation which provides food for large 
bands of barren-ground caribou. 
There are two large lakes in the lower country of the south- 
western part of the island called Nettilling and Amadjuak; 
both are upwards of a hundred miles long, and the low lands 
surrounding them are the favourite feeding grounds for large 
bands of barren-ground caribou. The natives from Cumberland 
gulf, Frobisher bay and the north shores of Hudson strait resort 
to the shores of these lakes annually to slaughter large numbers 
of these animals for food and for their skins, which are used 
for winter clothing and bedding. 
Bylot island lies to the northeast of baffin, being separated 
from the latter by the Ponds and Navy Board inlets. It is 
roughly circular in outline, with a diameter of nearly ninety 
miles. In physical character it closely resembles the north- 
eastern part of baffin, already described, being formed from 
crystalline rocks. The general elevation of the interior ranges 
from 2,000 to 3,000 feet, and the coastal highlands are covered 
with an ice-cap which extends ten or fifteen miles inland, the 
interior, according to the Eskimos, being free of snow during 
the summer. The ice-rim feeds numerous glaciers, some of 
which discharge bergs.
