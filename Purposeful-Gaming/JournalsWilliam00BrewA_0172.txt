line of mixed dry, bleached dead grass and living green grass
which stretched around the outer edge of the marsh I found
three nests with 4, 5, and 4 eggs respectively. All three birds were 
sitting. The first flushed at 10 yds. The second under foot 
while I saw the third on the nest craning her neck out of
the entrance to the nest. This last nest might have been 
found by looking for it without reference to the bird but the
other two were too well concealed to be detected by the keenest
eye. Curiously enough I either saw no[?r] heard any Sharp-tails, 
except those three sitting females, in this marsh. There were
a few Savanna Sparrow and one [male] singing. 
  Returning to the buggy, after taking all three nests with
their contents, we next drove across country to the Beebee's
woods where we walked the horse for several miles through
a succession of winding, heavily shaded wood paths. The
growth was almost wholly of oaks, white, scarlet and black, with
occasional pines (rigida) growing singly or in groves of
limited extent. Heard Red-eyes, Oven-birds, Creepers (Mniotilla)
Towhees (in remarkable numbers) a Brown Thrasher, Cat-birds, 
and Maryland Yellow-throats besides three Prairie Warblers 
and four Black-throated Green Warblers, the latter among 
pitch pines. Saw a Yellow-billed Cuckoo in the very heart
of these woods, On our return heard a Parula and a 
Least Flycatcher singing in elms directly over the main
street of Falmouth near the post office.
  After tea took a walk through the fields beyond the
Howards. Grass Finches, Savanna Sparrows and Meadow Larks
abundant and singing superbly (I mean the two latter, of course).
  Shortly after sunset I was electrified by hearing the familiar
call of the mysterious bird we christened the Kicker last
year. He was in a meadow just beyond the Howard's and 
sang steadily up to the time I went to to sleep for I could
hear him as I lay in bed with the window open.
