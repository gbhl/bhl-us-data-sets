a fire. I looked for Grouse. "Don" roaded
and pointed one at which I missed
a hard flying shot. Soon after saw either
the same or another bird on the ground
and shot it a fine plumaged adult
[female]. While eating lunch a flock of Parus
hudsonicus came about. After lunch
watched all the afternoon for Ducks
but curiously enough only one came 
back and that we failed to get a
shot at. Just at evening heard a
Grouse quit behind us and rising
saw it walking leisurely along and shot
it. A fine adult Marsh Hawk crossed
all over the marsh late in the day
There were three White-bellied Swallows
there also and some Titlarks. Saw a
Picoides arcticus in Leonard's Pond.
