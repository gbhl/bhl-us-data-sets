two teeth filled by Dr. Stearnes.
On the way in two men
tried to pick my pocket. Called
in at the Organ Factory and 
got some black walnut
sawdust. Went down to
father's office & bought some
eyes at Brewster's. Got home at
2 P.M. : then put the eggs in
one draw on the sawdust. In 
P.M. took a ride up to Watertown
on my horse and saw R.

called in & saw C. Carter.
In the evening stuffed the
crow shot yesterday.

  Alternately cloudy and clear.
Ther. 21[degrees] - 40[degrees] 38[degrees]. Set my alarm
clock last night for 5.10 this
A.M. but it did not wake
me. In A.M. rode up to Lexington
in the rockaway with C. Carter.
We spent all the day in walking
about but we did not not fire
at any thing. Built a fire and
toasted our dinner on a flat
rock. Saw two blue jays. I left
my drinking cup under a maple
tree for some time and got a
cup full of sap. Got home
at 5.15 P.M. In the evening
finished the crow stuffed
yesterday. Aunt Lizzie
came to day. Charlie
broke the lock of his gun.
