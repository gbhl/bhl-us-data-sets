logs in various stages of decay. The eye failed to
penetrate more than 50 yards into these woods for at
that distance the trunks became merged into a brown
or dark gray mass so thickly did the trees grow.
The trunks of the P. resinosa were strongly more reddish &
more slender than those of P. strobus.
  The woods extended along the roadside about a
mile. In them we heard or saw many birds.
A Grosbeak (H. ludoviciana) and Robin singing, a
Hermit Thrush calling, and several Woodpeckers tapping
were the most prominent. Besides these a Dend. virens
several Winter Wrens, Zon. albicollis, Parus atricapillus,
Certhia americana, and along the roadside Song Sparrows.
  In two places heard Sitta carolinensis & S. canadensis
at the same moment. A few Pine Linnetts flying
overhead. A Grouse (B. umbella) drumming. Juncos
everywhere both on the edges of the woods & in
their depths. Chewinks singing & calling, the song as
in the East, the chewink note shorter & hoarser,
usually only one syllable (wink).
  In a hollow where some beeches bordered a pool
in which hylas (H. pickeringii) are peeping a pair of
Wild Pigeons started from the ground and alighted
in a birch sapling. D. walked up to within about 18 yds.
(we had only a 32 cal. pistol) when they flew the
[male] clapping his wings sharply like a tame Pigeon for
the first few rods. On our return saw a [female] fly across the
road in the same place.
  Crossing the open near town we saw an Otocoris
alight on the fence. D. got out & shot it. It proved
to be praticola. On the edge of the big pines a Wood
Thrush was singing. In the fields a Meadow Lark. The
song of the latter as in Mass.
