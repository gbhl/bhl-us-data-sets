At 4 a.m. Orioles, Kind birds, Venies. Field Spar-
rows and Maryland Yellow-throats began singing
at nearly the same moment. Chiming Swift
careening over the hill-top in silence. A brow sit-ting
on the old poplar caring loudly, a single
Bull-frog trumping on the Great Meadow.
  The sun rose at 4:14 after that I heard
few birds. They all seemed to be engaged in the feed
ing. The Robbins ceased singing entirely before 4
o'clock. The first Red-eyed Vireo was heard at 4.17
three minutes after sun-rise. Shortly afterwards
two Downy Woodpeckers drumming, answering one
another alternately and about 300 yards apart.
A Flicker also drumming and singing. A Purple
Martini soaring overheard warbling. Its rich rolling
whistle deserves to rank as a real son. It expresses
hilarity and contentment.
  Before sunrise the Great Meadow was a bluish
or glaceous green: the young second growth Oaks
and maples a light vivid green, greener almost
than grass. The older growth a dull, dark green.
After sunrise the meadows were equally if not more
vivid green than the young woods.
  At 10 a.m. I started to drive to Cambridge
the wind had risen and flouted the leaves about 
drowning nearly all sound. I heard only two
Bobalinks and saw a few more. Six Barn Swallows
skimming over grass fields four young
just from the nest sitting on a telegraph wire.
Cambridge swarming with English Sparrows.
  Returned late in the afternoon, the sun
setting before I reached Lexington. Three Grass Finches
