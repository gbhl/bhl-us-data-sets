Friday, August 23, 1867.
  Morning opened raining & rained
with little intermition all day.
Ther. about 60[degrees] - 65[degrees] - 65[degrees].
Woke at 4 A.M. but it rained
so hard that I could not go
shooting. Read most of A.
M., & we made up a party of
seven & went in bathing in the
rain; water warm, very heavy
surf. After dinner the rain
held up a little & I went over to the
Eel pond & over to Little Boar's Land.
Shot 2 sandl. & a Wil. tern young.
Fired at another tern, a large gull,
& a green heron. Met Frank Philbrick
at the pond. The wind was very
strong. Mother was sick last night.
The yellow legs are all gone.
To bed at 8.30 P.M.
Cleaned my gun in evening.
