mullet were breaking, springing a foot or two above the
surface.
  But by far the most interesting feature of the scene
was the extraordinary numbers of Scaup Ducks & Coots. They
literally blackened the water from bank to bank
(at least half a mile across) of Banana Creek as far as
the eye could reach and in the air a continuous
stream of flocks flowed steadily and swiftly out
towards Indian River.  As our vessel moved on, the
sitting birds rose with a noise resembling a waterfall
or a heavy shower falling on a still pond. In every
direction the air was filled with thousands upon thousands
of birds as thick as swarming bees. This continued until
dark although we saw the greatest number near to
mouth of the creek. Probably two thirds were Coots (Fulica),
the remaining one third Lesser Scaups with a sprinkling
of other Ducks which we could not certainly identify.
At the fewest we saw not less than three million birds
in the hour & going only two or three miles.
  As twilight fell several Night Herons flapped past
us quacking hoarsely; a big Owl scaled across the open
water; several Snipe (Gallinago) squeaked over the marshes.
Innumerable frogs of several species, all new to me except
the crackling hylas, began a medley of sound that
lasted all night. Every few hundreds yards we
disturbed great beds of Coots, invisible in the darkness,
but making the sound of rushing water so loudly that
it could be distinctly heard in the cabin of the vessel.
  We reached an anchorage about 10 p.m. The moon
had now risen and added its charm to the perfect
southern night.
