Lake Umbagog, Upton, Maine
1886
October 12. Left Boston yesterday forenoon with Mr. J. C.
Melvin and reached Bethel late in the afternoon. Started 
this morning about 8 o'clock and drove to the Lake, reach-
ing the Lake House at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. Melvin 
walked through the notch and shot a Grouse in a tree.
  The day was warm and still and clear up to 10
o'clock, after which it was cloudy. It rained late in the 
afternoon and evening. Small birds were exceedingly  nu-
merous. Robins were in large flocks in the fields and Jun-
cos and White-throats were along the fence rows and wood 
edges. I saw one Hylotonus at Brooks's and two Picus vil-
losus by the roadside. 
October 13. A perfect October day, clear and still: the
Lake perfectly unruffled.
  We were off down river at 8:30 o'clock. We
landed at the third bend and beat the marsh on the south
side, flushing four Snipe. I shot one, but could not find 
it; and Melvin missed several shots, getting nothing. Off 
the Stone farm in the Lake we paddled to eight Sheldrage.
Shot down two and wounded two others, one of which I after-
wards got. They were M. serrator.

  Next out past B Point. The Lake was alive with 
birds. about eighty Surf Ducks were floating in a long line
off Great Island, and a flock of ten Greater Scaups was near
them. Two smaller flocks of undetermined Ducks were not far
off, and a Bonaparte Gull was flying about chased persis-
