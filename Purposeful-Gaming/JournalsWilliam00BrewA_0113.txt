1890
May 16
Waltham & Belmont, Mass.
A rarely beautiful morning the sky cloudless and of
a pale, tender blue, the wind S.W. and very light
- a mere breath, bearing the scent of innumerable flowers.
  To the Warren runs starting at 8.30 A.M., spending
most of the forenoon in the runs and driving back
by way of Rock Meadow in time for dinner at 1 P.M.
  From Mt Auburn to the Warren place we passed
through a succession of apple orchards, snowy with 
blossoms, and green fields spangled with dandelions
and buttercups. Orioles, Least Flycatchers, Yellow Warblers
and Vireos in the orchards and shade trees along
the streets, Bobolinks & Meadow Larks in the
meadows, all singing as if they would spit [split?] their
little throats.  The air fragrant with the odor of
apple blossoms and lilacs.
  In the cedars on the hill behind the Warren place
I found just two migrants a D. striata & a D. maculosa;
in the great valley with its several runs to the north
of this hill two more, a Parula and a D. maculosa:
in the dense cedar woods on the high ground north
of the valley two more D. maculosa while I heard
a fifth maculosa singing in Norway spruces as we
passed the Payson place. These were all the migrants
- except a Water Thrush in the Willows - which I saw
during the day. Faxon, whom I met near the
[?] spring, had seen a D. [black?]
two D. caerulescens, two D. maculosa and two Sylvania
Canadensis in Waverley and a Zonotrichia leucophrys
by the roadside near the east end of Wellington Dam
in E. Lexington. This for two observers on such
a perfect morning at the height of migration
