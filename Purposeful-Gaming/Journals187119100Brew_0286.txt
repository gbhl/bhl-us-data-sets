1887
May 16
Concord, Massachusetts.
  The morning opened cloudy but by 10 A.M. the 
sun came out and the remainder of the day
was very warm, tempered somewhat by an E. wind.

Langers and Grosbeaks were singing only fitfully. A 
D. carunlseus, however, was singing fairly steadily

a Wood Thrush. He was by far the tamest individual
that I have seen for several years.
  Returning down the lane to meet the buggy
 I saw two Sparrows dark across one plunging into 
a thicket on the right, the other turning back.
On reaching the shot I found several birds in
