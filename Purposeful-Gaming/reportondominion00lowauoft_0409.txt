NAVIGATION 287 
To the westward of Cape Weggs the general trend of the 
south coast is nearly due west, while the opposite side continues 
northwest to form Gordon bay, after which it bends to the west 
and south, so that at its western end the strait is about one 
hundred miles from mainland to mainland, but of this distance 
the practical channel is limited to that portion between the 
south coast and the large island of Nottingham, a distance of 
thirty-five miles. 
In the western half of the strait, Charles island, which lies 
about twenty-five miles beyond Cape Weggs, is the only obstruc- 
tion to navigation. This island is twenty-five miles long, and 
lies nearly due east-and-west, some twenty miles from the south 
shore of the strait. The ship channel passes to the northward 
of the island, although there is a good channel on its south side. 
The depth of water in the ship track through the strait varies 
from fifty to two hundred fathoms. There are no shoals, and 
with ordinary precautions, there is little danger from stranding 
on the bold shores of either side of the strait, or on the few 
islands that bound the channel. 
A number of safe harbours easy of approach have been ex- 
plored on the southern side of the strait, and others equally 
good and safe are known to be located on the north side, 
although they are at present unsurveyed. 
The passage from the western entrance of the strait to the 
port of Churchill, on the western side of Hudson bay, is five 
hundred miles. From the mouth of the strait the course is due 
west for seventy miles to the eastern end of the wide channel 
between Coats and Mansfield islands. This channel is practi- 
cally one hundred miles long, and varies in width from fifty 
miles at the eastern end, to over a hundred at the other. 
The general course of the ship track from the eastern end of 
this channel to Churchill is nearly southwest, and there are no- 
where any dangerous shoals or other obstructions to navigation.
