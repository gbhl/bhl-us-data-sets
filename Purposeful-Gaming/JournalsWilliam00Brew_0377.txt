Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Cloudy with pouring rain all day. Wind varying to every point.
  Late in the afternoon Jim rowed me over to the Outlet. Seven 
Winter and two Summer Yellow-legs on this marsh. Paddled within 
long range then backed out and tried to get warm but they
flew. I fired at about 60 yds. without effect. Then the flock
turned and came back over me when I killed one with
my left barrel. It scaled 100 yards or more and fell well
out in the lake. A Herring Gull descended to it and
apparently tried to pick it up.

  The report of the gun started up some Ereunetes & 
three Grass Birds. I shot two of the latter, one flying.
I also shot a Carolina Rail which fell wounded into 
the lake and dove as adroitly as a Duck using its
wings when swimming under water.

  We next went to Moose Point which proved a blank.
Then through Leonard's Pond when we started twelve 
Wood Ducks and a Solitary Sandpiper. Seven Black Ducks 
came in and circled around but did not alight.

  Returning to the outlet we flushed a pair of Ring-neck 
Ducks, a black headed drake & gray female. I saw the
gray spectrum distinctly as they went off. I could have
shot them easily had I been in the bow but Jim
was rowing at the time. It poured in torrents all the time
we were out. The Lake has risen nearly two feet and
the Snipe grounds are flooded and ruined for the present.

  To the Outlet in Rob Roy canoe shortly after breakfast. Heard a
Tringa maculata & shot a Colaptis. entire meadows under water.
To Moose Point at evening. Arrived too late & got into a 
bad position. A pair & three flocks of Black Ducks came in,
about 75 birds in all. Did not get a shot. Heard a Solitary and three
