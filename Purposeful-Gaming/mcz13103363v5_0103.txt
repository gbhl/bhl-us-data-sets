Washy & Theo had
already spoken.
Saw several dialogues
performed by the
girls and heard
Howe and Joe
Swaim speak.
Had a tub of lemon-
ade in the committee
room and altogether
had a pretty good time
of it. Took dinner at
the Nichols' & did not

  Clear and a pleasant
day. Ther about
70[degrees] - 80[degrees] - 70[degrees].
Rose rather early
and rode into Boston
with father in the buggy.
After buying several
things, he left me
and rode out alone.
I bought a pair of
handsome sleeve buttons
for $10.00 and several
other things & then
came out.
In P.M. rode up into
Waltham & got several
handsome butterflies.
In the evening, Mr. Dav.
harnessed his horse into
my buggy & we drove
over to "the pond" & went
in swimming together.
After getting home
caught some good moths
with his torch.
