1887                                        
June 4.  
Concord, Massachusetts.
Cloudy and cool with strong E. wind. A gloomy day
  Off in the canoe at 9 a.m. spending the
day up river.
  The strong, steady wind being fair most of the
way up stream I sailed, with only a few short stretches
of paddling from the house into the lower end of 
the Sudbury marshes the extreme point reached.
  On the way up I landed only once, at the maple
woods just below Nine Acre C. Bridge where I shot a fine [male]
Tanager.
  A great number of Crows (at least thirty) were mobbing
something of the Cliffs as I passed and as I was opposite
Conantum they flew over the river below me in close pursuit
of a Great Horned Owl.
  At the outlet of Pantry Brook saw a Turtle Dove flying
over the woods.
  Tanagers numerous in the second growth hard woods
along the rise from Fairhaven to the furthest point
reached. Several Grosbeaks singing, also, and a Grouse
drumming steadily at noon. Bobolinks scattered
along very sparingly, about one to each half mile.
Redwings nearly as numerous at below Concord.
  Swallows in considerable numbers everywhere over the
meadows beyond Fairhaven, the majority Banks, with
about equal numbers of Cliff, Eave and Chimney Swifts
and a fair sprinkling of White-bellies and Martins.
Fired about twenty shots at them, chiefly on my
return and got five besides two others shot down and
lost in the bushes.
  Landed in several places to search for Bobolinks
nests but without success.
  No signs of Marsh Wrens of either species. The flags
