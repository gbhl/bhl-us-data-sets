was seen or heard in the Buch Island meadow but
two [males] sang a few times after sunset in the cat-tails
just north of Pout Pond, a locality where there were certainly
none in June.
  At Pout Pond we heard a Wilson's Thrush sing twice and
a Cat-bird singing rather continuously. Saw no Herons
until nearly dark when three Green Herons flew in silence
from the Pout Pond swamp taking the usual course
towards Buch Island  meadow, two afterwards returning.
A little later three Night Herons also left this swamp
quawking loudly. They must have roosted there through
the day. We heard none on the direction of Buch
Island swamp, but saw a single adult bird flying
from that place at about 6 p.m.
  Although the evening was remarkably favorable for
hearing slight sounds, we listened in vain for the
faintest Rail note until nearly dark when a Carolina
Rail called ka-e twice in the flags near Pout Pond.
This was literally the only Rail heard. It is evident
that their singing is over for this year.
  Twice during the evening I imagined that I heard
the kik-kik-kik-kik, creee of our "mystery" but I was
perhaps mistaken. Certainly, this bird also, has
practically stopped singing.
  As it was getting dark a Solitary Sandpiper rose
from the Pout Pond bog within 30 yds. of us and
wheeling overhead made off to the E. finally pitching
down with wings closed. Its erratic Snipe-like flight
& characteristic peet-weet call were both unmistakable.
I do not remember to have ever seen it here so early before.
  Bull frogs, green frogs and toads all in full song
this evening. A Cuckoo cooing at intervals before sunset.
