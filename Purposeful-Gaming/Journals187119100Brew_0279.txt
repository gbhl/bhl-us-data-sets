(May 11) 
  I shot him (or rather her for it was a female) and 
found I had Lincoln's Finch. She was not 
at all shy and silent as usual.
  There were a few apple blossoms open to-day
but only a few. Pear trees are in full bloom,
sherry blossoms falling.  The trees in the woods
are only green in places were birches or poplars
abound; the oaks and chestnuts are still
perfectly marked of foliage.
  In a thicket of wild apple trees I saw
an unseen woodchuck finding on grass in
an opening. He was very suspicious of danger
pausing every minute or two and rising erect
to listen and look around.  Finally he wither
saw or winded me and galloped off.
