218 cruise OF THE NEPTUNE 
black shale containing Monograptus sp. and leperditia cfr. 
phaseolus is a bed of fragmentary limestone with Favosites, 
Strophomena cfr. pecten, Atrypa reticularis, Pterniea cfr. 
Sowerbyi. From a locality in gaasefjord, on the same horizon, 
were taken Favosites cfr. Hisingeri, favosites Gothlandicus, 
Thecia Swinderenana, Spirifer elevatus, Spirifer cfr. crispus, 
strophomena corrugatella, dav., Pterinea sp. According to 
these, the period of this upper part of Series B should be Lud- 
low. The thickness of the series is about 1,000 feet.' 
' In Hell Gate, as well as in gaasefjord, these strata are over- 
laid by Series C; in its lower parts consisting of interstratified 
light and dark marl schists, which are somewhat sandy, while in 
its upper part appear pure quartz-sandstone beds and argilla- 
ceous sandstone. The collective thickness of these strata is about 
1,000 feet in Gaasefjord, while in Hell Gate it is probably 
somewhat greater. no fossils were found in this series.' 
' At the base of the high cliffs at Indra Eide and Borgen 
appears Series C. In both of these places it is overlain by a 
dark limestone and black shale, partially fossiliferous. This 
dark limestone and shale are the lowest layers in a series of 
strata at least 1,500 feet in thickness, Series D, which appears 
in the profiles on both sides of Gaasefjord, from Borgen to the 
foot of Vargtoppen (Wolf Top), and from Indre Eide to 
Skrabdalen.' 
( In Series Da occurs Atrypa reticularis in great quantities, 
but little else. On the other hand, there are preliminary deter- 
mined in Db about fifty-five species, of which may be men- 
tioned : Favosites sp diV., columnaria sp., cyathophyllum sp. 
cfr. hexagonum, recaptaculites sp., Fenestella sp., Homalono- 
tus sp., burmeisteria sp., Dechenella sp., Proetus sp., Orthis 
striatula, Leptaena sp., Strophomena., streptorhyncus, Atrypa 
reticularis, aspera; rhynchonella (Pugnax) cfr. reniformis, 
pugnus, Productus cfr. prolongus, spirifer of the verneuilli
