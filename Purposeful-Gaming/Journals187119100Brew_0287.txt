(May 16) The thicket but at first could see nothing
that looked like a Sparrow. Finally, however, a 
small dark-colored bird that had been keeping
behind the stem of a poplar hopped out in fair
vein within then yards of me and I at once
 recognized him as Lincoln's Finch. Before I could 
back off far enough to shoot he flew and crossing the 
lane plunged into a tangle of cedars and ground
jumper whenever he had probably came in the 
first place. I followed at once and starting 
him had a fairly good, but rather long, shot.
At the report he few again, evidently badly wounded,
and was at once lost to sight in the thicket
It was very provoking.
  White throated Sparrows still linger in small
numbers. I saw a little flock to-day, most of
them very dull-plumaged birds.
  Apple trees are in bloom everywhere now but not
at their fullest. Their woods are fast becoming green
an the oaks are very beautiful with their purplish
red leaflets.
  Mosquitos are already are the war path but the
worst pest now is a small black fly that looks
exactly like the northern black fly and behaves
in a similar manner but does not bite quite
as viciously. Then little insects have abounded for 
several days past. The moment I enter the woods
I am surrounded by a cloud of them. I always
find them in our woods at this season but
do not remember to have ever seen them in 
such numbers before. They do not last long
if I remember  rightly.
