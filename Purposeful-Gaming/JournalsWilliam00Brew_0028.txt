Apr 12 1888
about midway between the three nests that promised best
I shouted and thumped the the trees but started nothing.
  Returning to the edge of the water I shouted for
Denton when a shadow glided past my feet and 
looking up I saw one of the Hawks sailing high
overhead. At the time I suspected that she had
flown from the large nest in the tall pine just
behind me and this was doubtless the case for after
climbing to the other nests and finding them empty
Denton found in this nest a set of two eggs one of
these much incubated. While he was in the tree a
Carolina Dove passed giving me a long shot which I
missed. I also saw here a March Hawk & a Great Blue
Heron and shot a pair of Brown Creepers.

  Crossing the river we next landed near the
stubble field. It was alive with birds Fox Sparrows about
the outskirts, Song Sparrows and Tree Sparrows along the
walls and finches, Grass Finches Savanna Sparrows and
Juncos feeding near the middle. Of Juncos we saw at
least 300 in a single flock. There were also a few
Redpolls with the Juncos & a single Goldfinch. Denton also
found a Creeper in some neighboring pines. In the heavy
pine woods on the hill to the south we started a Cooper's
Hawk & saw a Pine Warbler. During most of the
time we were here it rained more or less heavily.

  Started up river at 4 P.M. rowing slowly & keeping
near shore. Red-wings singing on the maples & willows,
scattered about. Shot several. Saw a large flock flying
high apparently migrating. Higher up they were very
numerous, singing on every side. As we reached the
Manse the clouds rolled up from the western horizon
and the sunlight poured a flood of warm, strong yellow
light over the hills, houses, and fields.
