1886
June 10
Clear and warm.
  In the house most of the day. Late in the 
afternoon drove to the Weston farm, going by the way
of Sandy Pond and returning via the Walden road.
Saw two Tanagers, and heard a Golden-wing
Warbler in some two-year-old sprouts (oak and
chestnut) near Walden.
  Summer comes on apace. The foliage is thick-
ening, and deepening in tint. The Bull-frogs have
been in full tune for four or five nights and they
also bellow freely by day. The kitchen plant is in
blouse in the meadows. The blue flag([?]) along
the river. The blue-eyed grass has taken the place
of the yellow-eyed which has quite gone out of
bloom. The Houstonia is still luxuriant as
when we came to Concord, but one has to search
for it among the rauk grass.
  Along the river banks the blue-joint is now
fully six feet high. It is suffocatingly hot in
mid-stream. The channel, in shallow places is
fast becoming choked with aquatic vegetation,
chiefly a species of Polygonum,  I believe.
