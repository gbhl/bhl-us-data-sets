closely but could see nothing of the bird. One had a root
bank of earth towards me and as I stood within ten feet of
this the Grouse drummed evidently close to the root at the base
of the log on the other side. I saw the dead leaves on the
ground to one side whirled about as by an eddying gust of
wind. The closing part of the drum was less confused than at
a distance. Retreating I made a half circle & finally saw the
bird standing [?]est as a post his body apparently no thicker
than his neck. He looked for all the world like an upright,
grayish stick. I waited a moment but he would not
drum again and I shot him.
  next went to the small forest pool where we saw the
Pigeons yesterday. As I was crossing the inlet brook on a log
the [female] flew from a branch overhead & alighted within
fair range on a hemlock bough, occillating her head & neck.
I shot #10 at her but she went off followed by the [male] leaving,
however, a stream of feathers behind.
  From the pond struck over the ridge to the camps.
Dense hemlocks mixed with pines & beeches all noble old trees.
Snow lying in wasted drifts in the hollows. Certhia am. &
Sitta canadensis very numerous. Saw three pairs of Certhias
at one time, one of them building. Near the camps in
dead pines shot a pair of Picoides arcticus. Several P.
villosus cackling & squeaking. A Cooper's Hawk skimming
close over the ground passed within ten yards of me.
A Brown Thrasher singing near the camps.
  Dwight returned & we drove out to the road. On the
way a [female] Pigeon started among some bushes & alighted
again allowing us to drive nearly under her. I
got out and shot her.
  Hyd[?] ludovicianus very common & singing gloriously
the song echoing in the arches of the woods. Home at sunset.
