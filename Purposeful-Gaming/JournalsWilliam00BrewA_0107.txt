1890
May 7
Waltham-Belmont, Mass.
Clear and cool with chilly N. to N.E. wind.
  Starting at 8.30 a.m. I drove to the
Warren place in Waltham. Left the road at
the old barn and climbing the hills descended
into the valley beyond and worked up through
the runs coming out on the cross road
when George met me with the buggy. We
then drove home by way of the "Willows".
  Birds were rather numerous but there were
few new comers. It was a poor singing day
owing, probably, to the chilly wind, but
Brown Thrashers, Black-throated Green Warblers,
Black & White Creepers and a few other species 
were in good voice. I heard two Pine Warblers
on the hill behind the Warren place and
two Nashville Warblers in the runs, Chestnut-sided
Warblers were also singing freely. Curiously enough
I heard only one Field Sparrow but Grass Finches
were singing all the forenoon. Saw a [female]
Black and Yellow Warbler and a Red-eyed Vireo,
both silent. The Black & Yellow was among 
cedars on the edge of one of the runs. King birds
were rather numerous and Oven Birds exceedingly
so and singing freely. The Thrashers were the 
most conspicuous and noisy of the 
singing birds throughout the country bordering
the runs. I heard them everywhere, often 
two or three at once. Probably most of
them are migrants. On the drive home
heard a Bobolink in full song in Waverley.
Meadow Larks are very numerous this year.
I heard four different birds this morning
