BEHAVIOUR OF THYLOGALE BILLARDIERI 
(4) Feeding and Drinking: 
In the wild, pademelons eat a wide variety of grasses, shoots and leaves 
(Mollison, 1960). In captivity all grasses in the pens were grazed, as well as 
leaves, bark and supplementary foods. Forepaws were sometimes used for picking 
up food and parting thick grass. 
Regurgitation in the rufous-bellied pademelon appeared to be comparatively 
infrequent, being observed only siX times during the period of study. The process 
seemed identical to, but less frequent than, that described for the quokka 
(Moir, Somers and Waring, 1956). Pademelons re-ate all spilled material after 
regurgitation, and chewed the bolus in every case. 
Drinking was most commonly seen when the animals began grazing in the 
late afternoon. 
(5) Grooming: 
Grooming was a prominent activity throughout the day. Three general modes 
of grooming were observed: - 
(a) Licking - Mainly used for pouch and abdominal cleaning. The tongue 
was used to clean while the snout nuzzled into the fur. Forepaws were often used 
to part fur to facilitate licking ( Fig. 2 ) . 
(b) Scratching with Forepaws - Used in grooming flanks, tail, back, 
abdomen, chest and face. The forepaws scratched vigorously through the fur and 
were often licked clean. 
(C) Scratching with Hindfeet - Used in grooming head and shoulders. The 
hindfoot has a syndactylous inner claw which Wood Jones (1924) considered to 
be an adaptation for combing fur. 
Pouch cleaning may be considered as a specialised type of grooming 
(Fig. 3). It was observed in females both with and without pouch-young, and was 
essentially as described for the red kangaroo (Russell, 1970a). 
Pademelons groomed at various times during the day while at rest. They 
awoke, stood erect, and groomed for varying periods (1 to 10 minutes), then 
lapsed back into the resting posture and returned to sleep. This pattern of waking, 
grooming and sleeping often continued for some hours. Finally in the late afternoon 
the animals became more active and groomed again for a considerable period 
(usually more than 15 minutes) before beginning to graze. Grooming appeared 
to increase after rain, and in some observation periods after heavy rain it was 
the predominant activity. 
Mutual grOoming is discussed under mother-young interactions. 
( 6 ) Vocalisations : 
The following vocalisations were heard: - 
(a) Growling - Low intensity sounds made by the dominant individual in 
an aggressive interaction. Both males and females used this sound, which was
