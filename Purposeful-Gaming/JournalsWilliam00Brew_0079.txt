June 8
Concord, Massachusetts.
Clear and hot: wind strong from S.W.
  To Concord by noon train with Denton, our object
being to find some Bobolinks' nests. Gettng my boat
at the Manse we started down river at 1 P.M. Just
below the bathing place found a Kingbirds' nest which held
one egg on which the bird was sitting. A little further
down D. discovered a Yellow Warbler's nest at least 25 ft.
up in a maple. It was finished but empty.
  Opposite "the tent" a Warbling Vireo was singing in the 
cluster of maples & poplars where there has been one for
the past two seasons (although in 1886 I shot either one or
both birds) and we landed to search for its nest which
D. finally found by climbing to the top of a maple into 
which I saw the [?] fly several times. It could not be
seen from the ground. it held only one egg which we left.
  Upon first landing and before finding this nest we saw 
a [female] Bobolink alight on a tall weed and after looking about 
a moment pitch down into the dense grass of a mowing
field. D. ran to the spot & flushed her under his feet 
and I, following him more slowly, found the nest which
contained a full set of six eggs.
  We next landed at the rock where I shot the Prothonotary
in 1886 and searched the neighboring thickets for nests
finding only a Cat-birds with 4 fresh eggs. A Least Pewee 
and Yellow-billed Cuckoo singing besides numerous Yellow
Warblers. D. killed a black snake which we cut open
finding in his stomach a young Song Sparrow, feathered
& but barely large enough to fly.
  Our next landing was opposite "Hunts Pond". We
first beat the meadows down river seeing several
Bobolinks but finding no nests. Returning I flushed
