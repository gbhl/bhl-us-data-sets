nor nest.
  The only migrant noted to-day was a single D. striata
singing in oak scrub.
  Common birds were numerous everywhere. I heard three
Grass Finches, three Nashville Warblers, six or eight brown Thrashers,
three Wilson's Thrushes (one singing) two Cat-birds (they are scarce
this year on all my grounds), a Grosbeak, eight [male] Chestnut-
sided Warblers, a Black-billed Cuckoo, one Pine Warbler and
no less than four Indigo Birds. A Bobolink was singing
in the meadow when I found the nest in 1874. On
the drive home I heard two on the slope just west of
the Belmont engine house and one in the fields at
the corner of School St. below the Albens place.
