1889
Oct. 22
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Clear. Very cold at sunrise, day warm with steady S.W. wind.
  Rose at 6.30. While waiting for breakfast saw a fine adult 
[male] Buffle-head floating on the calm surface of the Lake opposite
our camp. Jim paddled me out but just before we started
two Whistlers joined our bird and of course started him long
before we were within gun range.

  Just after breakfast a pair of Buffle-heads, the male a superb 
adult & perhaps the same just mentioned, alighted in the cove
just north of camp. I went overland to the water's edge but
they swam across to the Moll's Rock shore and began diving
there. Accordingly I returned & Jim paddled me across the
mouth of the cove. Landing just inside the Rock I
went through the woods and by making three runs when
the birds were under water got within good range, I fired     
as they came together killing the adult male. The other bird
dove, quite by chance, just as I pressed the trigger & I
had to fire the other barrel at her after she came to the
surface. On my way through the woods I passed within 
a few yards of two Grouse. After killing the Ducks I
went after them but only found one which rose among
dense bushes & went off unshot at.

  We next rowed down the Lake to the Hayward
farm where we landed & I walked around the entire
opening. Saw only one Grouse which Don pointed & I shot. 
Came on a Porcupine feeding on grass, apparently, & photographed 
him. Saw a Gos-hawk chase a Robin into some low 
willows where he overtook & killed his bird. I went in of course
& flushed the Hawk but missed a hard snap shot. He
carried off his prey whose feathers strewed the ground.
