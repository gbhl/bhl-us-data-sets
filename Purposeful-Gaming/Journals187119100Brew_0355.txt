with necks streched up looking and listening intently for
danger. timid, beautiful creatures they little suspected
the peril they were in. However, they escaped it for
they were so scattered that I could not get two
together and waited for them to "bunch". Instead
of doing this,[however]], they first swam across the
pond and then closing in together entered a long
winding creek where they were lost to me as the
banks are to treacherous to be followed after dark
I waited long in hope they would return but
they did not although I was several times deceived
for a moment by bright silvery wake of a
muskrat.
  I also saw in the twilight a large bunch of birds
passing high overhead in a dusky fall.  They looked
very like Teal.

  Paddled home in the rain without a single
bird to pay for all my trouble.
