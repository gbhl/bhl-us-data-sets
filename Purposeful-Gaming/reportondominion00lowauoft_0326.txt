216 cruise of THE NEPTUNE 
observed in the midst of the section of Cape Victoria Head. 
Indistinct Orthoceras, Lichas and Symphysurus assign this 
limestone to the Lower Silurian period.' 
' Above the othoceras-bearing, light-coloured limestone bed 
are some less extensive strata of alternating limestone and 
quartz-sandstone, and finally a 100-foot bed of close brown lime- 
stone of which certain layers are fossiliferous, and gave an 
Asaphus., traces of other Trilobites and some gasteropods.' 
' Following the direction of the dip to the north side of 
Princess Marie bay we find it again, though seemingly some- 
what abrupter, in the limestone beds of Norman Lockyer island. 
A fauna with halysites sp., Zaphrentis sp., Orthisina sp., 
rhynchonella sp., Leperditia sp., illaenus sp., &c., assigns this 
limestone to Lower Silurian. It is again found with its fauna 
at the base of Cape Harrison; in this case with a thick super- 
incumbent bed of marly sandstone, quartz-sandstone, and finally 
extensive limestone conglomerate. This also occurs near the 
shore in Cape Prescott, indicating by its presence in the strike 
of the limestone of Norman Lockyer island the disturbance 
undergone by these tracts. 
' The line along which this disturbance took place is refound 
on the west side of .Franklin Pierce bay, where the beds of lime- 
stone conglomerate dipping from the heights of Cape Harrison 
are cut off in the strike by a limestone, dark-gray in colour and 
broken into a breccia.' 
In another place Schei hints that the rocks of the Cape Raw- 
son beds, consisting largely of dark shales and impure lime- 
stones, found along the northern parts of the eastern shores of 
Ellesmere, may be of Triassic age, in sharply folded troughs of 
the older rocks, and consequently much younger than Cambrian, 
to which age they were referred by Fielden and De rance. 
Writing of the Silurian beds found on the southern coast of 
Ellesmere, Schei describes them as answering to the northern 
series, and their occurrence is as follows
