1890
Oct.27
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
  Cloudy with heavy snow squalls in the afternoon and
high N. wind.
  At sunrise Jim discovered a small flock of
"Sea-Ducks" in the Lake near Metalluc Island and
as soon as we could despatch breakfast and
get the boat ready we went in pursuit of
them. They proved to be Butter-bills, sixteen
in number, all brown birds. We got within
less than 30 yds. of them without apparently to much
[?] attracting their attention for they were bathing
and playing up to the last moment when
they suddenly took wing. I fired both barrels
(of the Fox 12g. gun) as they passed shooting down 
five and wounding another which we afterwards
secured after a long chase. The ten survivors
went only a few hundred yards before realighting
and we were getting up to them a second
time with [any?] prospect of another good shot 
when the steamer appeared on the
scene, whistled, and started them. As 
they went down into the Tyler Cove and 
as the N. wind was fast getting up an
ugly sea we returned to camp.

  The remainder of the forenoon was spent
in taking down the tents and packing
the smaller things ready for the steamer
which came at about 2 P.M. and took 
us all down to Lakeside.

  There was a tremendous sea running in
the afternoon and we saw no Ducks save
a few Sheldrake flying. Also saw a brown Eagle.
