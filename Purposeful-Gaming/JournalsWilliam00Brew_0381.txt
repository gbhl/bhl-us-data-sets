1889
Sept. 25
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Cloudless, the air clear as crystal, the mountains wonderfully distinct.
A light east wind all day.
  Breakfast at 6.30 and off at 7 for the Megalloway. As we 
Passed through Moll's Carry, the fog began to taker on a rosy tinge
and before we had made a mile up the Megalloway it was
rent by the combined influence of the sun's rays and the rising
breeze, drifting away in fleecy masses over the woods
disclosing a scene of surpassing beauty.

  We paddled through Horse-shoe Pond without finding any birds
then crossed the river to Pine Hill Pond where I discovered five
Wood Ducks sitting on a log, sunning. Landing I crept to the 
water's edge but found the distance too great for a good shot.
I then returned to the river, landed above and made a
second stalk coming out within about 40 yds. Only one remained
on the log. The other four were scattered about swimming &
feeding. Finally they drew in together & I fired stopping
three with the first barrel and the fourth as it rose. Two took
to the grass where Don speedily found them. I photographed
two of them on the log propping them up with sticks.

  Next stop at Pulpit Rock Pond. Three Hooded Merganser, two 
Wood Ducks and four Black Ducks in this pond. Stalked 
the Mergansers and fired one barrel stopping two. Saw the Black 
Ducks coming straight for me and getting in a fresh shell
made a clean double as they passed within about 40 yds.
One of my Mergansers escaped by diving although at one time
I could have shot him easily enough.

  Jim going back to the boat came on a flock of six 
Grouse & shot one with the 20 g. I afterwards followed
them up and killed four more, one on the west bank
of the river. A little above this pond flushed a Hooded 
Merganser as we rounded a bend and dropped it
with the 20 gauge. It dove at once and escaped. When
