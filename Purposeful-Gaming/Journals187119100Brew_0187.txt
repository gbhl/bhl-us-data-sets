reigned in the woods along its banks. Upon landing
opposite Birds-nest Island, however, we startled a 
little family of Crow Blackbirds from the tree bushes
in the Swamp when they had evidently gone
to roast for the night.
[margin]Prothonotary 
Warbler[/margin]
  Returning to the boat we had just started
down stream when a bird darted out from the 
bank and flew swiftly across the river passing
within 15 yds of us. To my utter amazement
I recognized it at once as a third Prothonotary 
Warbler, seeing the golden head (it was evidently a male)
and breast, white abdomen, and blue rump and wings
too distinctly to be mistaken. It played into 
a thicket on the east bank when I followed
it. I am not certain that I saw it again but
an almost [?] I did once and perfectly [?]
that I heard its characteristic series of sharp
chirps twice. P. also thought he saw it fly
back across the pines which I was on shore.
  No birds singing at sunset. A large number
of Warblers migrating from 8 to 11P.M.
  At about 11 P.M. we heard two [?] Owls
whirring in the trees over the Avenue to the North
Bridge. Later they came into the Manse orchard.
When they called to one another for several [?]
making a sound new to me, a short rolling
cry something like that of a tree [?].
