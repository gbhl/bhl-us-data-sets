APPENDIX Iv. 335 
(p)-in a yellowish-gray dolomitic limestone: 
CEPHALOPODA. 
1. Actinoceras keewatinense, Whiteaves. Several siphuncles of 
this species recently described by Dr. whiteaves occur in the 
collections from Southampton island. 
(q)-collections of Stromatoporoids from Southampton Island: 
Sixty-three microscopic sections have been submitted to a pre- 
liminary examination, and the following species among 
others, appear to occur: 
1. clathrodictyon regulare, rosen. 
2. " fastigiatum, Nicholson. 
3. sp., cf. 0. striatellum, Nicholson. 
4. " (?) crassum. Nicholson. 
Some of these are parasitic on Favosites gothlandicus, Lamarck.' 
They are referable to the Silurian, about the age of the Niagara. 
PRELIMINARY LIST OF ORGANIC REMAINS FROM LOOSE BLOCKS of LIME- 
STONE, CAPE CHIDLEY. 
(a)-from the drab-coloured limestone: 
POLYZOA. 
1. Pachydictya, sp. indt. 
BRACHIOPODA. 
2. A strophomenoid shell with sculpture of Strophomena vari- 
striata type occurs in the collection with sieberella galeata. 
3. Trematospira, sp. indt. 
4. Conchidium decussatum, Whiteaves. 
5. Clorinda, sp. probably a new form which I would designate, 
Clorinda lowi, N. Sp. 
6. Sieberella galeata, Dalman. A form which is very near the type 
of this cosmopolitan species. If it prove a variety or muta- 
tion, I should designate the same as var. Chidleyensis, N. var. 
The above are all of Silurian age.
