rose from the grass where the water
was a foot deep. Found a Black
Duck dead on the bank where I
lost a wounded one a few evenings
ago. Thence to Whale Back Cove. Saw a 
few Sheldrake. Lunched at Crocker's
Camp ground. Shot Hermit Thrush
making queer noise. Returning to
camp saw a Duck Hawk perched
on a stub only two feet above water,
near Outlet. It flew and passed me
at 75 yds. Shot both barrels without
effect. Saw a flock of about 30 Black
Scoters off rock and went in pursuit
but failed to get a shot. Saw 6 White-
wings in North Bay.
