in a moss - [?] apple tree. I looked carefully for the
nest but could not find it.
  The woods are now nearly - but still not quite - in full
leaf. Columbine are still in bloom but past their prime. [?]
in full bloom about ledges and in crevices of boulders in the
open pastures showing in fair contrast to the gray [?].
  Besides the Prairie Warbler's nest I found two cat - birds'
(4 & 1 eggs) an Oven - birds' (3 fresh eggs), a Chestnut - sided Warbler's
(empty). I did not take any of them.
  There were a few migrants about to - day. Before starting
this morning I heard and saw a [?] [male] [?]
in a cherry tree in my garden and near the head of the 
birch [?] I found a Black - poll, a Canadian Warbler (shot)
and a [male] [?], all together in a branch and all
[?]. I also found and shot a [female] [?] in
rasberry bushes in an open pasture
