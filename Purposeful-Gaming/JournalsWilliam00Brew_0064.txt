warbling. A Myiarchus calling among some ash stubs; Jays
screaming in the distance. In the water numerous small
minnows coming to si[?] the crumbs we threw to them.
A cray-fish or two crawling on the bottom under the boat.
Several Ardea herodias fanning their slow way across the
lake above. A Buteo pennsylvanicus screaming.
  Hearing a Grouse drum several times apparently near
at hand I landed and went in search of him, 
supposing him to be not over 50 yds. off. I went nearly 
200 yards through the worst arbor vitae swamp I ever
saw before I finally discovered him sitting on a large
pine log. He was about midway of the log and sat
so still that I looked at him for several seconds
before I could be sure that he was really a Grouse
or indeed a bird of any kind. Finally I shot him.
There was a great quantity of droppings in two places
on the log. I had a hard task to get back to the boat
carrying both gun and bird and more than once I
slipped off a skinny log & into the ice cold
water beneath.
  On the way home we saw only a very few
birds, a Crow, five Golden-eyes, and a Broad wing
Hawk. The latter I saw pounce down into the log
heap behind the bath house. As we got opposite the
spot he flew up & alighted on a stub where I
shot him. His legs & feet were gummed over with
a black, sticky substance which I took to be pitch
mixed with crock from burnt stubs.
  In the shallow water near shore we saw a large
dead salamander & a live fish which I took to
be a wall-eyed pike. The latter was only about
six inches long.
