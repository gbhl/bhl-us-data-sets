646 VITALITY AND EFFICIENCY WITH RESTRICTED DIET. 
level walking, and yet it would be recorded as one unit by the pedom- 
eter. Indeed, with level walking a marked change in the character of 
the terrain would alter the calorific value of each pedometer unit. 
Walking on a smooth and level sidewalk would have one value; walk- 
ing over slippery ice would have a value which would be the resultant 
of a shorter step and accompanying increase in the leg tension for 
balance. These pedometers were worn the entire day. The men were 
cautioned, when riding in automobiles or trolley cars, to be sure that 
the motion of the vehicle did not cause registration. These false 
records, however, probably play very little role in the series as a whole. 
It is perfectly conceivable that the activity indicated by a half hour 
of wrestling or calisthenic exercise in the gymnasium, with jumps up and 
down, is not at all comparable to the equivalent number of pedometer 
units registered while walking, hence, it must be recognized that the 
pedometer does not differentiate in the character of these various units. 
We must further consider the factors contributing to activity in 
general, as recorded by the pedometer. These may be summed up as 
follows: First, the novelty or the psychological effect is a stimulus to 
increased record. This would be expected to appear, if at all, in the 
first week of wearing the instrument. The further possibility of a 
psychological effect with the squads expressing itself in a desire to 
make a better showing at the start than a competitive squad should 
also be considered. A second factor would be weather conditions. 
With fair weather, such as that obtaining in early fall, walking would 
be more pleasant than in bad weather, such as might occur later in the 
season. During icy conditions there would be less tendency for walk- 
ing but, as pointed out previously, there would follow a distinct change 
of gait, and possibly a shortening of step with a consequent more rapid 
registration of pedometer units. It should likewise be remembered 
that with this shortened step on an icy walk there would be a greater 
consumption of energy for walking the same distance. Third, with 
time available for walking so limited during the busy college year, 
relaxation and recreation would be first sought in walking, as was clearly 
shown by the records for the Thanksgiving and Christmas recesses. 
Fourth, the state of nutrition would also affect the inclination for 
walking. 
As has been pointed out, there is a reasonable relationship between 
the quantity of walking registered by the pedometers and the net 
available energy in the diets for corresponding periods of time. 
And yet on close inspection we can not convince ourselves that this is 
of special significance, because several other factors must be taken 
into consideration, such as the psychological factor mentioned above 
and the time available for walking in the vacations. On the assump- 
tion, however, that to walk a horizontal mile requires 60 calories, it is 
very clear that the differences in miles walked at the different stages
