1889
Oct. 12
Cloudy with strong N.W. wind. No rain. A raw, dismal day.
  Jim called me early reporting a flock of Coots on the
Lake. After a hurried breakfast, we started in pursuit of 
them. We soon saw them flying and watched them for
a long time as they coursed up & down the Lake but
failed to mark them down. While we were searching
for them the wind rose and the Lake was soon
covered with white caps. As it bid fair to be a rough
day we gave up the Coots and started for Sweat Meadow.
On the way saw a Cedar Bird feeding on black alder 
berries.

  Reaching the meadow we paddled in over the bank
and entered a tract of stubs on the right. Started a
flock of seven Black Ducks which rose out of range. 
Paddled to the head of the pond & shot an adult
D. coronata where the brook comes in. Next landed
on the west side. A Grouse rose and flying almost 
straight upward alighted on the naked branch of a
yellow brick where I shot him.

  After lunching we tramped up over the ridge & 
descended to a beautiful little pond. About 15 Black 
Ducks in it. Jim stalked them, twice & brought down one
wing broken but it escaped into some alders. A
Canada Jay screaming like a Hawk on the shore.

  Returned to Sweat Meadow & paddled into the stubs
where we started the Ducks this morning. The same flock
was there. We lay in wait for them and after a while
they swam within shot. I killed two with the first
barrel but failed to get in the second.
  As we  neared Moll's Carry the sun had just set in 
a patch of clear sky. Jim pointed out a small
Owl sitting on the slender spire of a tall dead stub.
We pushed into the stubs & I shot him. He proved a Hawk Owl
the first I ever saw living.
