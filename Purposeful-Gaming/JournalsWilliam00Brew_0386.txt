Oct. 1
  Pouring rain all day up to 5 p.m. when suddenly the
clouds broke away and the sun streamed out forming
a superb rainbow or rather two rainbows with thin
bases together but arches extending in opposite directions

  Left B. Pond at 8 a.m. in a pouring rain. Crossing
the ridge to the Oxford Club house I saw only a few
Sparrows & Olive-backed Thrushes. Chadbourne killed a
Grouse & afterwards two more on Rapid River Carry.
Near Oxford Club I saw a mixed flock of fully 100 birds.
They seemed to be mostly Kinglets (R. satrapa) with 
a few Chickadees, Myrtle Warblers & three Solitary Vireos.

  I went down to Lakeside for the night with Chadbourne
who starts for home to-morrow.

Oct. 2
Cloudy with frequent light showers. Wind strong from the
N.W. A raw disagreeable day.
  Jim arrived at about 8 a.m. with a Summer Yellow-leg 
which he shot near the Lake House. We started up the
Lake at eleven hunting the Sweat Cove carefully on
the way. Near the pine island, three Black Ducks 
jumped and I made a clean double getting
both birds. This was the only shot that I fired
all day.

Shooting[/margin]
  We saw two more Black Ducks and two Whistlers
in Sweat Cove, an enormous Sheldrake near the
Narrows and about thirty Black Ducks in Black
Island Cove. The latter we came very near getting
shots at but once we showed them the boat before
we were quite in range & again turned the boat &
paddled out of a little nook when if we had gone ten
yards further in we should have had a good shot.
