Oct. 16
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Clear and still, the Lake calm nearly all day. Morning
cold, water freezing, noon deliciously warm.
  Early this morning Jim shot a Scoter (O. americana) 
which was swimming past our landing. It was very
thin & had a broken wing.

  After breakfast we started out on the Lake. Saw a
flock of seven light-coloured birds which I took to be
Old Squaws swimming off B. Brook Cove & a pair of Scoters
in the cove below the camp. Started for the latter when
they separated & began diving. Seeing that they were 
wounded birds we turned back for the flock but it
had disappeared. Rowed to Metallak island. No birds
in Tyler Cover. Hearing a sound like escaping steam we
looked up & discovered a flock of nine Scoters scaling 
down from an minimum height. They alighted near Great Id.
This was about 10 a.m.

  Making a fresh start we went down river to Sweat
Meadow, I in the Rushton canoe. A Titlark & a Spotted 
Sandpiper on a boom of logs near Moll's Carry. An
adult, [male] Golden-eye in full plumage in Sweats Meadow 
pond, diving, He saw us, rose, & came back over us
at about 150 ft. height. I fired one barrel at him in vain.
The shot started nine Black Ducks which flew directly
to the forest pond behind the birch ridge. We followed  
them. Creeping to the edge of this pond I saw a Duck
feeding about 50 yds. away. Shot at & wounded it. It 
flew into some alders where Don flushed it & I killed it.
To my surprise it proved to be a Wood Drake. I had
taken it for a Black Duck as it was between me & the pines.
The shot started about 15 Black Ducks from the pond.

  Started for Lakeside about sunset. On the way flushed
our nine Scoters. Saw a very large bat & several musk rats.
