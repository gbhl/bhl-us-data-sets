Oct.17
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
  Cloudy and warm with no wind. Rained heavily from daybreak to
dark.
  Melvin left me this morning and started for home. I spent
the day at camp skinning birds etc. The Canada Jays came
at frequent intervals in spite of the pouring rain. Their
plumage did not appear wet or draggled in the least.
A Fox Sparrow also visited the camp and pecked at some
meal and bread crusts that the cook had thrown out
for the Jays.

Oct.18
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
  Cloudy, mild and dead calm with occasional light
sprinkles of rain.
  Spent most of the day about camp. A Fox Sparrow, presumably
the same seen yesterday, was pecking at the crumbs and
meal again this morning. The Canada Jays came, also,
of course and I heard two Parus hudsonicus the first
since the day we pitched camp.

  Late in the afternoon I rowed over to Pine Point
and called on a Mr. Osgood who is camping there.
As it was getting dark I crossed the Lake to Moose Pt.
There were eight Snow Buntings feeding on the seeds
of grasses along the shore & I heard a Swamp
Sparrow in the marsh which is now flooded
Five or six Black Ducks came in and alighted
in the grass. One of them quacked almost
incessantly for ten or fifteen minutes making a
great racket for the night was very still.

  Nearly an hour after dark - and it was very dark to-night -
as the men were eating supper in front of their tent
a Partridge suddenly rose from within the circle of
light of their lantern not 15 yds. away. It flew a long distance
back into the woods & we did not try to follow it.
