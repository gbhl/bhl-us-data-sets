1890 
Oct. 3
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Cloudy with the sun shining dimly at intervals. Nearly dead
calm all day with an occasional light air from the S.E.
  My three men worked hard all day at the shed
camp which was finished by sunset. It is 12 x 12 ft.
I spent most of the day overseeing their work but in
the morning rowed over to the marshes at the Outlet
where I spent about to hours beating for Snipe. I
have never seen the grounds in such perfect condition
before but I did not succeed in [starting?] a single bird
although I found their droppings in two places. During
the morning the only birds of any kind that I saw
on these marshes were two Savanna Sparrows, a Swamp
Sparrow, a Titlark and a Horned Lark. The last was
flying. It came directly over me and [?] a number
of times so that I made perfectly sure of its identity.

  It is strange that there were no waders on the marshes
or mud flats at the Outlet. I did not see or hear so
much as a Peep. About several of the shallow pools the
water and mud was covered with the feathers of Black
Ducks and I saw other familiar signs of their recent
presence such as torn up roots of aquatic plants etc.
They doubtless visit these marshes at night to feed
and spend the day in some of the back ponds. The
hunters camping on Moll's Rock keep up such an
incessant racket with their rifle practise, shouting 
etc. that it is no wonder the shyer birds avoid
the marshes opposite.

  Heard a Hylotomus near our camp and received
an early morning visit from a pair of Canada Jays.
In the evening Hylos were peeping in the woods and 
mosquitos were numerous enough to be annoying.
