1890.
Sept 28.
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
  Morning clear; afternoon cloudy. Wind N. to N. E. raw and chilly.
Spent the morning about the house. In the afternoon took a sail
on the Lake going up as far as Great Island. Although I skirted 
the shores for some distance I actually did not see or hear a bird 
of any kind during the entire trip.
  After returning I walked along the road as far as the Sargent
place. Heard Hermit Thrushes clucking and two White-throated
Sparrows singing.The leaves are turning fast and a few are begin-
ing to fall but the woods are still green in most places.
  Pearley White's son brought in two Spruce Grouse which he killed
on the Mollidgewank road to-day.
