bevy and the survivors flew less than 100 yds.
alighting in the same belt of weeds at the
end of the fence where the dogs found them
and C. and I each killed one. A moment later
I killed a second & missed one. Three or four
flew back to where we first started them and
we killed three of them, then two of which fell
to my choke barrel at my long range, one after
C. had fired at it. This ended the day's sport.
  On the drive home I saw a fox squirrel
climbing the stem of a tall, slender pine.
C. got out and shot at it about sixteen
times before bringing it down. It was much
slower and clumsier in its movements than
the gray squirrel.
  We saw many Pine-wood finches to-day
and I shot one that the dogs put up
in an old field.
  Passing through Orange City we saw a flock
of eight or ten Quiscalis aglaeus in an orange
grove near a house. This Grackle is apparently
a rare bird here.
  We saw no Florida Jays to-day and for
perhaps the first time, no Buteos. The two
Pied-billed Grebes were in the same part
of the same pond as yesterday.
  The country which we hunted over
was flat pine land with frequent orange
groves and old fields grown up to weeds
and broom grass. It had little low palmetto
except in places about small ponds.
