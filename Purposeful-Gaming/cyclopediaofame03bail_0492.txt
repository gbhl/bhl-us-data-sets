The Principles of vegetable-gardening 
By L. H. BAILEY 
458 pages-144 illustrations - $1.25 
egetable-gardening books are usually mere alphabetic 
cyclopedias of directions. This book states the reasons why. It 
discusses fully the underlying questions regarding Soils, fertilizing, 
tilling, storing, marketing, controlling insects and diseases, and other 
Vital present-day problems. It treats the general subject of truck - 
gardening and market-gardening; also the home garden. After 
these general matters are fully discussed, the treatment of each 
vegetable is taken up and the principles of its cultivation con- 
sidered. 
The classification is into natural cultural groups, so that it is 
possible to state all the principles which pertain to any class of 
vegetables, without much repetition. Thus, root crops are treated 
by themselves; so are salad crops, bulb crops, and the like. Par- 
ticular attention is given to hotbeds and coldframes; also to seeds 
and seed-growing. 
Full estimates are given of the capital required for market - 
gardening. The book contains a complete list of all American 
books on vegetable-gardening.
