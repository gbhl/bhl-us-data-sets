June 3
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Showery with occasional intervals of sunshine.
High N.W. wind all the afternoon
  After spending the morning in the house & the
early afternoon in a drive to Fifty-acre Meadow,
I started in my canoe at 5 p.m. for the
Great Meadows intending to search for Bobolinks
nests.  The weather was perfect for this purpose,
cloudy with a high N.W. wind that tossed the
grass about and drowned all sounds.
  Landing opposite Hunt's Pond I beat the
dry ridge carefully down to the bend below,
finding nothing. On the return, however, I took 
two nests with sets of six eggs each within 100 yds
of one another.
  A little above the canoe I got a third set of
six eggs. For a long time after this I found
nothing probably because the wind had died
away and the [male] Bobolinks began to sing. At
nearly the last ground however I took a fourth
set of 5 eggs.
  My method was to quarter the ground so closely
that with the help of a paddle which I kept
bringing scythe fashion through the grass, I practically
covered every yard. In every case I flushed the [male]
with the paddle often nearly striking her as she
fluttered off.
  I saw a Night Heron and heard a Bittern
boom once or twice. There were perhaps fifty
Swallows over the meadows. Mosquitos out in
full force. Saw the first firefly. A few
Hylas still jumping. Garden toads making a
deafening din everywhere.
