1886
May 18
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and rather warm. Wind West.
Off in the morning for two or three hours driving to
Lincoln by the Sandy Pond road and back by way
of the turnpike. At Sandy Pond I heard a Golden 
Wing Warbler and got a fair shot at him, but he
flew just as I was about to fire.
  I did not shoot anything whatever until 
we reached Halls on the way back. Here I spent
about an hour in the birches. Birds were more 
numerous than hitherto with a fair sprinkling of 
emigrants. I saw only one species not already
noted, a Thrush which I took to be T.
It was in an old orchard and was very shy.
  I flushed a large Woodcock near the spring hole.
It was apparently a [female], but it showed no signs of 
having either eggs, or young, merely rising with a 
heavy whirring and making directly off.
  The apple blossoms were falling fast to-day
Rhus vemirata just leafing out and looking 
deceitfully like a young ash
