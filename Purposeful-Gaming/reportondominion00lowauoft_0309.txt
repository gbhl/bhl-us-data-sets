small outlier at Silliman's Fossil Mount near the head of Fro- 
bisher bay. This locality was visited in 1897 by a party from 
the Peary Arctic expedition of that year. In the course of a 
few hours they obtained fifty-four species of fossils from this 
locality, which were later named by C. Schuchert. 
Dr. Franz Boas describes the nucleus of the mountain masses 
of Baffin island to be everywhere gneiss and granite, with Silu- 
rian limestones about the region of the large lakes of the interior 
and along the low lands of the west coast. 
Dr. r. Bell visited the north shores of Hudson strait in 1884 
and 1885, and again in 1897, when he made a close examina- 
tion of the coast from the neighbourhood of Big island to 
Chorkbak inlet near Gordon bay. Dr. Bell describes the prevail- 
ing rocks of the southern shore of Baffin island as consisting 
of well stratified hornblende and mica-gneiss, mostly gray in 
colour, but sometimes reddish, interstratified with great bands 
of crystalline limestones, parallel to one another and conform- 
able to the strike of the gneiss, which in a general way may be 
said to be parallel to the coast in the above distance. The direc- 
tion, however, varies somewhat in different sections of the coast. 
* The distinguishing feature in the geology of the southern 
part of Baffin land is the great abundance, thickness and regu- 
larity of the limestones associated with the gneisses. At least 
ten immense beds, as shown on the accompanying map, were 
recognized, and it is probable that the two others, discovered in 
North bay, are distinct from any of these. There would, there- 
fore, appear to be twelve principal bands as far as known, to 
say nothing of numerous minor ones, between Icy cape and 
Chorkbak inlet. The limestones are for the most part nearly 
White, coarsely crystalline, and mixed with whitish feldspar. 
The limestones usually contain scattered grains of 
graphite, and among the other minerals which commonly occur 
in the various bands are mica, garnet, magnetite, pyrite and 
hornblende.'
