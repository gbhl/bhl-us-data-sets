1886                                     
June 18
Concord, Massachusetts.
  I came to Princeton yesterday, and this morning
drove over to North Rutland with M, to visit our farm.
  In Princeton last evening I heard in the
valley, below the Wachusetts House, a wood thrush
singing at sunset, and a little later a Whippoor-
will.
  On the way over to the farm this morning I heard 
and saw a Henshaw's Sparrow singing on a stonewall
by the species last year.
  On the farm in a dense wood of pine, hemloc
and hardwoods, I heard a Canada Flycatcher, a solitary
Vireo and a Parula.  Of the latter I also heard two
other males in other woods in the same locality.
  Indigo Birds were common (they have been
rare this year in Concord) and I found a nest
with three eggs far advanced. Besides the above
we met with nothing of any special interest.
  Returning to Princeton late in the afternoon
we had tea and afterwards drove to  Redescription Rock
and back by another road, skirting the base of Mt.
Wachusetts and passing around the Wachusett Lake.
  The Mountain laurel was in full bloom forming
a snowy carpet in the woods and patches of rose
and white on the open hillsides where the rushes
were much taller and their blossoms deeper-coloured.
  In the meadow behind (or below) Redemption Rock
two Henshaw's Sparrows were in full song in the evening
twilight. Grass Finches were common everywhere and
in full song. I heard no Henrick Thrushes either here
or elsewhere during this trip. Early next morning
