without getting a shot. during this time
only seven Ducks alighted in the meadow.
They were all nervous and suspicious and
would not go to feeding. As I was lying
concealed a number of small birds came 
about; four Juncos, a Certhia, some Chickadees
and two Hermit Thrushes. I could [hear?] a
Sitta canadensis in the [?] on the hill.

  At about 4 p.m. Jim returned and we
started for the little pond under Errol Hill.
On reaching it we found it fairly alive
with Ducks representing no less than four species.
Near the [?] at the inlet about [20?] Black Ducks
were "tipping up" in the shallow water, while
four Whistlers, six Sheldrakes, and at least three
Buffle-heads were scattered about over every
part of the pond diving for food or floating 
asleep well out from the shore. The breeze had
all died away and the surface was agitated
only by the ripples made by the water-fowl
which kept rolling in from different directions.
I watched the beautiful birds for over an hour 
and was glad that none of them tempted
me to shoot. I did indeed covet one of the
drake Whistlers but they kept out of range.
A [female] Whistler passed me within 20 ft. making
short dives along the water's edge & a Buffle head
dove many times within 20 yards of my
ambush. One of the Whistler drakes went to sleep
and floated for a long time [?] with head 
buried in the scapular feathers. Heard a 
Barred Owl hooting near this pond. Reached
camp at dark without having fired a shot all day.
