76 cruise OF THE NEPTUNE 
ing Akpatok island, which he named Desire Provoketh, on the 
11th of July, he reached the islands of Gods Mercies, and thence 
sailed along the south shore of the strait, naming it Magna 
Britannia. He passed into Hudson bay on the 2nd of August, 
through a strait about two leagues broad. The southern head 
of this was named Cape Wolstenholme and the northern one, on 
an island, Cape Digges; a bold headland six leagues to the 
northward was called Salisburies Foreland (Salisbury island). 
Hudson's journal ends on the 3rd of August, and the remainder 
of the melancholy story is told by Abacuk Pricket, who states 
that they were frozen in, on the 10th of november, in the south- 
east part of the bay, after sailing three months through a 
labyrinth of islands. Dissensions had early sprung up among 
the crew, and in the June following a mutiny broke out headed 
by Robert Juet and Henry Greene. On the 21st Hudson was 
seized by the conspirators, and, with his young son, forced into 
a small boat. The carpenter, John King, accompanied him 
voluntarily, while six sick men were also forced into the boat, 
which was cut adrift, never to be heard of again. On the way 
home juet and other of the leading mutineers were killed by the 
Eskimos at Cape Digges, and the remainder only reached Eng- 
land after great sufferings from famine and other hardships. 
In 1612, Sir Thomas Button, accompanied by Bylot and 
Pricket of Hudson's crew, entered Hudson strait through the 
channel between Cape Chidley and Button islands. Having 
passed the strait, he continued westward, passing the south end 
of Coats island, which he named cary's Swan's nest, and 
reached the western side of the bay, to the northward of Chester- 
field inlet, where he named the land ' Hopes Checked/ because 
his progress westward was thus arrested. Turning south, he 
followed the coast to the mouth of the Nelson river, where he 
wintered. His crew suffered greatly from scurvy, but an 
abundant supply of birds and fish in the spring recruited the 
strength of the men sufficiently to allow them to continue the
