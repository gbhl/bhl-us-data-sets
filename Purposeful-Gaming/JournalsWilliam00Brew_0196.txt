1888
(Nov. 28)
Grouse until near sunset when"Don" found two on
the edge of the dense oak scrub when we saw a
Cat Bird late last autumn. I did not get a shot
at either of these birds.
  Lunched on the bridge over the large brook that
flows through the western ground. Met two men
there who were searching for a bevy of about a
dozen Quail which they have seen, they said, several
times this season. They were armed with
muzzle-loaders, a rare sight in these days.
  During my tramp I saw one Jay, a small
flock of Chickadees and three Tree Sparrows. Small
birds are evidently very scarce at Grantville this
season
