or more in width. At the lower end the stream passes
under the road and broad noisy streets pass along both
sides of the swamp. On two sides, also, houses are crowded
closely together and horse cars pass through one of the
streets which, after dark, was brilliantly lighted by
electric lamps. There was an incessant rumble of wagons,
shouts of boys playing ball, shrieking of steam whistles,
and occasionally the clamor of a street band. It
seemed very strange to hear such birds as Rails,
Marsh Wrens and Least Bitterns amid such
surroundings. One side of the swamp is within the
limits of Boston.
