1888
Nov. 6
Belmont & Lexington, Mass.
Cloudy morning clearing at 10 A. M. Afternoon partly cloudy
partly clear. Very warm - ther. 70[degrees]. Strong S. W. wind.
  With Spelman started at 9 A. M. for the Bryant farm
in Lexington where according to popular rumor many
Quail have been seen of late. We set off in a covered buggy
taking "Don" of course. Near the farther end of the Willows
saw a fine adult Buteo lineatus sealing over the road.
Nothing else - save a few crows - was observed on this drive.
  Reaching the Bryant farm we stabled our horse and
crossing the fields to the south began to beat the range
of birches, alders & weed fields where, on my last visit with
Robert Nesbitt ten or twelve years ago, we shot several Grouse
in a bog meadow among tussocks of tall grass.
  Scarcely had we entered this meadow to-day when "Don"
drew to a doubtful point holding his head high, a
[?] expression about his face and attitude. I was working
out to him over some very soft ground when a large fox
started about 20 yds. to windward of him & galloped quickly
out of sight.

  This entire cover with its bordering fields proved blank as
far as game birds were concerned but in the birches we
found a large flock of Robins and in a maple swamp I
shot a [female] Picus villosus. Don made some fine points
at a flock of pigeons in a grain field and S. took
several photographs of him.

  Crossing the road to the north side we spent the afternoon
beating the birch swamps and runs lying in that direction.
We saw several flocks of Robins, some Blue Jays etc. but no
game birds until we reached the edge of the meadow where
"Shot" made several points on Grouse years ago. Here in a
belt of alders "Don" came to a stand. I stepped in ahead
