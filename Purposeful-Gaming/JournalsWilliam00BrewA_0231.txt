Sept 23 (Continued)
Lake Umbagog, Maine
  We next skirted the edge of a great hillside pasture seeing a
great number of Sparrows among which were two Lincoln's Finches. 
Both were flushed from fine dry grass in wet hollows. One flew 
into some bushes where I shot it, the other escaped into thick 
spruces & was seen no more.

  Descending the hillside we crossed the road and H. went down
into the intervale after some Flickers one of which he flushed from
the grass & shot. The report of the gun started a Sparrow which 
flew about 100 yards very much in the manner of a Savannah Sparrow
and alighted in the short grass in a mowing field. Upon going to
the spot I flushed it and I saw at once that it was a Lincoln's 
Finch and finally shot it in a brush fence in which it finally
took refuge. As I was wrapping it up Don started another from a 
bunch of grass near me but it made a long flight & escaped.

  We finished the day by beating a tract of dense young spruces
growing on very wet springy ground where H. killed two Woodcock one over
a steady point. Don also pointed a third which rose wild &
went off unshot at. 
  The drive home in the twilight although cold was very pleasant.
