VOYAGE TO THE BAY 
21 
an old Eskimo, named Scotty, were secured as pilot for the 
launch, while another, Gilbert, consented to pilot the ship to 
fullerton harbour. 
The crew of the launch consisted of the second mate, third 
engineer, a fireman, sailor, the interpreter, Scotty and myself. 
We left the ship early on the morning of the 23rd, and the 
launch behaved admirably in the heavy head sea raised by the 
recent gale. A southerly course was followed, past Depot 
island, but the numerous shoals gradually forced us away from 
the mainland, so that the boat was ten miles from the main- 
land at the mouth of Chesterfield inlet, and even at that distance 
considerable difficulty was experienced in keeping clear of the 
shoals. They were eventually passed without mishap, and the 
course was changed to westward along the south side of Promise 
island, and then along that of the inlet, so that by dark we were 
fifty miles above its mouth. After steaming twenty miles 
farther, on the following morning the lower Eskimo settlement 
was reached, situated on a large bay on the north side of the 
inlet. All the men were absent hunting deer, and although 
there were many skins about the encampment, the women would 
not part with them without the permission of the men. The 
latter were not expected back until the next evening, so it was 
determined to continue on to the upper encampment, located 
thirty miles above the lower, on the southern channel, past 
Bowell island, where the inlet discharges from Baker lake. 
This encampment was reached early in the afternoon, and the 
absent hunters were signalled for with smoke. They arrived 
about two hours after us, and a lively barter was kept up until 
after dark, upwards of fifty skins and a considerable quantity 
of meat being purchased for powder, tobacco, knives and files. 
Four tents of Eskimos were at this place, which is a noted 
crossing of the deer in their annual migrations to the north and 
south. Great numbers had already been killed, and half-putrid 
heads were scattered in all directions about the tents.
