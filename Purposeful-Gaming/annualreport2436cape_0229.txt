to four per cent of the Late Howe blossoms on the State 
bog were conspicuously mal-formed by the disease be- 
tween July 20 and August 1, when this effect was most 
marked. An occasional Early Black flower was similarly 
affected. A few of the small berries were also somewhat 
discolored and covered with the spore powder of the fun- 
gus. With the coming of August, the wet season ended 
and the disease soon disappeared on both blossoms and 
vines. 
STORAGE TESTS 
A study of cranberry storage was started last fall. 
I will not describe the various tests, but will merely out- 
line their purposes and results. 
I judged from general experience and. a slight 
knowledge of the behavior of other fruits, that the stor- 
age shrinkage of cranberries was due to several causes. 
The direct loss from decay due to fungous diseases 
seemed the most important of these. The loss of water by 
respiration also seemed to be a large factor. To ascertain 
the relative importance of these losses, the effects of 
ventilation and the lack thereof were studied, the amount 
of rot under varying conditions of ventilation and the 
amount of weight shrinkage of berries in the mass and of 
volume shrinkage of the individual berries being 
determined. 
With the temperatures that prevailed in the base- 
ment of the screenhouse, ventilation seemed to be an im- 
portant factor in cranberry keeping. Berries in coffee 
cans, with covers on tight, but not sealed, rotted much 
more rapidly than those stored in picking crates. A dif- 
ference in the keeping of berries in various parts of the 
crate was discovered, the top fruit keeping best, While 
that at the center decayed most. Berries in crates with 
slatted bottoms and sides lost in weight considerably 
faster than those in crates with solid bottoms and slatted 
sides and the latter, in turn, lost faster than did berries 
in boxes with both bottoms and sides solid. The loss in
