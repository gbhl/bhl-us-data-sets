pushed our way in among the trees the snow fell on us
in showers whenever we touched a branch.
Our first bird, as on Mt. Watalic, was a Ruffed Grouse
which sprang from under a spruce within a few yards
of us and hurtled off up the mountain side. We afterwards
started another from a similar shelter. In both places the
ground under the spruces was thickly covered with tracks
but neither bird had covered more than a few yards
during its morning ramble.
We next met a little flock of five Chickadees apparently
having a hard time to get a breakfast among the
snow-encrusted evergreens. Less than 200 yds beyond them
we suddenly heard the sharp, emphatic notes of Parus hudsoniicus
and soon a single bird of this species flew from a grove
of tall, old growth spruces into denser, more shrubby
pasture growth. Here he kept closely concealed & we did
not get another fair view of him. As we were following
him we heard a Pine Grosbeak call and Faxon
saw the bird, flying high overhead.
After this we heard or saw several more Parus atricapellis,
two Sitta Canadensis and a single Blue Jay.
We walked nearly to the Billows Pipe at the
head of the valley and returned along the cart path.
Fox tracks were numerous especially about springy
places & in the open pastures. Among the spruces
we saw tracks of the red squirrel but none
anywhere of rabbits although two species (L. americanus
et sylvaticus) are said to occur in the spruce pastures.
The numerous noisy little brooks (called "gutters")
which tumble down the mountain side literally every
few rods were very beautiful to-day being arched 
over in places by snow or ice. We reached the house
late in the afternoon.
