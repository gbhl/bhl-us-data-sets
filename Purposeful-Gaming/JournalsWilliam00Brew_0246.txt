missed only one fair shot at Ducks but failed
to kill several long ones. The pair of teal alighted
among the decoys and I killed them both
at one shot, sitting.
  I also shot an adult Ardea caerulea in moulting
plumage and a fairly good Ardea kucoviciana. many
others of both species passed me within close
range but most of them scaled off before the
strong wind when I rose to shoot & so quickly
that they would get out of range before I could
pull the trigger.
  A fine adult [male] Marsh Hawk came towards me
and by squeaking a little I called him to within
twenty yards but I fired both barrels at him in
vain although he finally dropped dead in the
scrub several hundred yards away.
  We left the stands about 4 o'clock when it
was evident that the enormous flight of Ducks
which passed over them yesterday was not to be
repeated. In fact we saw very few Ducks to-day.
As I was leaving the stand a Florida Black Duck
came nearly within range, quacking loudly.
  All day long an immense flock of Red-winged
Blackbirds haunted the vicinity of my place of
concealment feeding along the piles of eel grass that
lined the shore. Swamp Sparrows were numerous in
the bushes, I heard the unmistakable note of a Water
Thrush along the creek. Saw several Carolina & one Virginia
Rail. Royal Terns in flight all day. On the way home
a flock of sixteen White Pelicans (the first I ever saw)
passed us. they flew in a v like Geese, all flapping
their wings together, then sailing. They were striking objects
against the dark water.
