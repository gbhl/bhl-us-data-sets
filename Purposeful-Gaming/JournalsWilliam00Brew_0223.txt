1889
Feb. 9
Enterprise, Florida.
Clear and hot. Ther. 78[degrees] at noon with no wind.

did not take until flushed a second time. We
killed five single birds, C. three and I two, both
missing one shot.

before finding the next bevy which "Robin" pointed
in a grassy place by the roadside. C. killed two
and I one bird at the first rise. The others
scattered in every direction and we picked up only
four of which I shot two. the dogs returned only
one bird at the place where the bevy rose. Then

which were some 40 y[ar]ds ahead. Seeing this I
did not fire but C. unfortunately did not
notice the setters and shot at the bird missing
it but hitting poor "Prince' who shook his
