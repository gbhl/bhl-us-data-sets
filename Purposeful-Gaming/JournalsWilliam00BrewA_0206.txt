[Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts]
spotless nuptial dress and two or three others had only a 
little white about the head. I saw only two that I
felt sure were young.
  When I was within about 40 yds. the flock rose and after
circling over me, scattered. At the same time a number of
Wilson's Terns rose from their nests on the higher central position
of the island. I landed and found about twenty nests, 
all with eggs. None of them held more than 2 eggs and only
two less than that number. They were very similar in
position and composition also being placed, without exception,
on little sand knolls and surrounded by a few weeds or
tufts of beach grass and lined with a little dry grass or sea
weed. I did not examine any of the eggs closely. Took
a number of photographs of their nests and several of
the birds on the bar. Found Least Terns breeding numerously
quite to the end of the beach. 
  Starting at 1 P.M. I sailed to Edgartown quickly and
very pleasantly, the wind being fair and sufficiently
strong. As I passed near some of the grassy hills on
Chudquittick I occasionally heard Yellow-wings and Song
Sparrows singing. 
  Spelman arrived at 5 P.M. and we started at once for 
Great South Pond taking the canoe with us in the wagon.
Pipilos were singing in the oak scrub along the road and 
Meadow Larks on the plains where we also saw an Upland
Plover flying about. We heard only one Grass Finch
sing and no Savanna Sparrows. Barn Swallows numerous.
Reached the pond at sunset and embarked at the 
herring ditch, Spelman taking an old skiff which we
found there. I sailed and he rowed. We reached the
place where I camped with Mansfield at about 9 P.M.
and landed there to spend the night. Saw only a few
Herons certainly not over a dozen or fifteen.
