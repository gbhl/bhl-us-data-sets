like manner to strongly foliated hornblendic and chloritic 
schists, usually freely penetrated by quartz veins holding quan- 
tities of pyrite and other minerals. 
In passing Westward from Ungava bay the granite predom- 
inates along the coast, and the areas of the altered bedded rocks 
and their accompanying traps are much smaller, and are so inti- 
mately intruded by the granite that it is very difficult to 
separate them. The gneisses of the altered Huronian rocks can 
only be guessed at, by their texture, light colour and the pre- 
sence of garnet in them. The ancient traps and greenstone 
masses are more easily separated from the complex, but they are 
so penetrated by the granites that it is impossible to trace them 
except on a large scale detailed map, which would require many 
years' work to complete. 
Large masses of these basic rocks occur along the coast in 
several places between Cape Hopes Advance and Douglas har- 
bour, most noticeably about Wakeham and Fisher bays, Where 
quartz veins are numerous, and carry considerable quantities of 
sulphides. 
The examination of the coast to the westward of Douglas 
harbour was only such as could be made from the ship, and 
lacks all the detail of the eastern portion. red granite gneisses 
appear to occupy the greater portion of the coast, with areas of 
dark basic rocks at intervals. At Sugluk bay, Where a closer 
examination was made, a medium to coarse-grained pink to red 
mica and mica-hornblende granite-gneiss was most abundant. 
This granite inclosed bands of a lighter coloured quartzose- 
gneiss, and also intruded large masses of dark-green altered 
diabase. 
The granite-gneisses occupy the coast to within a few miles 
of Cape Wolstenholme, when the prevailing rock is a rusty fine- 
grained sillimanite-gneiss containing scales of graphite and con- 
siderable pyrite in small grains disseminated through the
