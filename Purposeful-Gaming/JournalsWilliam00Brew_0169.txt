Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Leading to this stub was the track of a
Red Squirrel Leading away from it the
same track with a spot of blood about
two inches in front of each mark of the
fore paws. The inference is plain. A
squirrel saw the Hawk fall seized him
and carried him off. I followed the track
into a tangle of alders and fallen trees and
finally had to abandon it. Don" failed
to show any signs of scent. An added proof
that the Hawk was taken off bodily
Lunched in the usual spot. Woods filled
with Yellow-rumps. Titlarks over the mead-
ows in swarms. Thence into Curtis' mead-
ow. Yellow-rumps in flock of 50 or more
out among the grass perching on the
floating stems. A pair of Red-tailed Hawks
among the stubs. Another Pigeon Hawk.
Three Black Ducks came in and alight-
ed. They rose wild and came down
past us about 80 yds. off then turned
and came past again at about 60 yds.
I shot both barrels each time but only
wounded one which flew out of sight
Near the outlet of the meadow a Shel-
drake started. I shot at her at about 70
yds. and missed. Another passed over
high on the river and I missed a-
gain. Then back to Leonard's Pond.
Two Wood Ducks where I shot the two
this morning. It was too late to stalk
them and they rose out of range as we
