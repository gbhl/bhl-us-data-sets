got only eight or nine shots bagging four 
birds of which I killed two with two misses
and C. two with three misses.
  The drive to Oak Hill was very pleasant
and interesting, most of the way through
open pine woods with one fine hamock
and in another place a bit of soft marsh
bordered by extensive prairie dotted with
palmettos as far as the eye could reach.
  Saw many small birds but nothing of
peculiar interest. Flickers, Pine Warblers,
Blue birds and Meadow Larks were singing
most of the forenoon. The Meadow Larks
were very numerous about the soft marsh.
I heard several whose songs closely resembled
those of S. neglecta. About a large pond
many Buzzard (all C. aura) were sailing
and a flock of about thirty Ardea [?]
rose from the sand and soared and 
circled over the place before realighting the
young (white) birds (about half of the flock)
making a fine contrast of color with
the adults.
  Reached Oak Hill at 2 P.M. Found a 
large rather shabby hotel perched on the
top of an immense shell mound overlooking
Hillsborough River. Fish Hawks exceedingly 
numerous, dozens in sight at a time. Saw five
at one time on one dead tree eating fish.
Saw a Brown Eagle chase one twice but each
time he failed to make the Osprey drop
his fish. Royal Terns, Killdeer, & shrikes in 
sight from the room.
