1887
June 2
Concord, Massachusetts.
Cloudy and calm up to 2 P.M. when a brisk
E. wind rose, changing to S.E to S. Warm and "close".
  Down river at 11 a.m. spending the day,
going as far as Carlisle Bridge, landing only
at Ball's Hill.
  Nearly opposite the Y elm I saw a male Grackle
emerge from a hole in the end of a maple
stub about 35 ft. high bearing in its bill the 
excrement sac of the young. The female entered the
hole as the male left it.
  At Ball's Hill shot at Wood Pewer, a Blue Jay
and a Virio flavifrous. A D. striata singing in
the pines.
  The songs of various birds were audible at 
unusual distances in the still, damp air as I 
paddled down stream. I heard a Lanager
nearly quarter of a mile away and Wilmore Thrashers
and Groosebeaks almost as far.
  Took the nest of Wilson's Thrush found May 23.
Also a Red starts in a maple fork nearly over it.
A Grouse drumming on the old Stone wall
across the swamp on I was packing these eggs.
  Redwing's nests nearly flooded by the water
which has risen about two feet from the recent
heavy rains, I examined eight or ten which
were only a few inches above the surface. Found 
one in a maple at least 5 ft. above the river
among the finer twigs (upright).
  A Turtle Dove flying over the pitch pine woods
on Dakin's Hill. Saw no others.
  Two Bitterns booming near the middle
of the meadow as I passed on the way
