To the Members 
Tell others who are interested in ferns about the Society, what 
it has done for you, and what it has to offer: 
Help for beginners; Herbarium specimens and back num- 
bers of fern periodicals which may be borrowed; Occasional 
free distribution of specimens of rare species; THE AMERI- 
CAN FERN JOURNAL: Opportunity for exchange and for 
getting into touch with others of like tastes 
We 
want more members: The Society can reach its fullest 
possibility of usefulness only when all who care for ferns belong 
to it.
