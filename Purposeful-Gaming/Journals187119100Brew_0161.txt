for half-an-hour or more. At Sunset we heard
Towhee, a Swamp Sparrow, and a few Long 
Sparrows. After dark a Black-billed Cuckoo.
  Sailed most of the way back to town. The 
night was still and clear with a half moon
and light S.W. west. Warblers were lisping overhead
almost incessantly; thus must have been a 
heavy flight of them. Along the river we heard 
one or two green frogs and a high bull frog.
  The autumnal tree crickets were in full cry
along tree slope of Fairhaven Hill; I have heard 
only one or two in the town.

  I forgot to mention that at noon I 
took a walk on Ripley's Hill and flushed a 
Woodcock on its east slope. Also saw a Red-bellied
Nuthatch in the pitch pines and several least
Flycatchers and Phoebees.
