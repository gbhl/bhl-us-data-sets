1889
Sept. 28
Cloudy with a few gleams of sunshine and occasional flurries
of snow. A raw day with high N.W. wind.
  Started for Megalloway at 7 a.m. Spelman & Sargent 
accompanying us. Just above the mouth of the Megalloway
saw three Canada Jays. A little higher up Jim discovered 
three Grouse on the west bank. I shot two of them but 
the third "trud" & then flew before I could get a shot
at her.

  I had no more shots until reaching Bottle Brook Pond.
Creeping in to the lower cove I found a large flock of
Black Ducks there. After lying in wait for fully an hour 
I finally saw them coming directly toward my ambush.
They swam to within twenty yards of me when I fired
the first barrel into a perfect mass of them, and cut
down a single bird with the second a they rose.
To my amazement and disgust not a single Duck
remained on the water where I fired the first shot
although there were many feathers. Probably most of them
had their heads under water when I fired. I could
not see distinctly through the thick brush in front of me.
In a few minutes a large flock of Black Ducks returned &
fed down towards and past me. I tried to stalk them
but Spelman who had arrived in the mean time showed
himself & started them. Afterwards I ambushed the
same flock in the upper cove. They swam past my stand
within ten yards, bunching beautifully but I wanted the
Mallard which kept apart. Finally I killed him & a Black 
Duck at one shot, my second barrel missing. Several
Mergansers & one Whistler were with the flock.

  On our return we paddled up Bear Brook half a mile or more.
Shot two Wood ducks on the water. One had a broken wing. On 
our return fired at 4 Black Ducks at 40 yds. & stopped two. 
Don found one in alders on shore. Used the 20 gauge entirely to-day.
