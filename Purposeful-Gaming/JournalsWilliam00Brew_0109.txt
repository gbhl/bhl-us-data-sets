1888
Sept 10.
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
  Clear and hot, wind W. strong in P.M. Started
at 8 A.M. for the Sluice. Spent nearly an hour at
landing on Cambridge waiting for boat. Woods
alive with birds a Picoides, a Sphyrapicus, several
Sitta Canadensis. Warblers, Turdus swainsoni, Red
Squirrels, barking snickering and chasing one
another. Finally started. Paddled carefully to Forks.
Saw no large birds save a pair of A. herodius.
One or two kingfishers, Scattered Warblers and Titmice,
many Kinglets, Two Parus hudsonicus. Lunched
at Forks. Looked vainly for a Woodcock which
Lumen started there yesterday. Then on through
the meadows. Nothing but a few Sparrows rustling
in grass. Then through green woods to Sluice.
Nothing but Robins and Thrushes T. swainsoni
feeding on berries of V. opulus and one large
mixed flock of Warblers among them 2 H. peregrina
2 H. ruficapsis and 1 My. Canadensis. Fished below
dam at sunset. Took 5 trout, one ¾ lb. and lost
a 1½ lb. fish. At twilight a Woodcock passed the
tent uttering its twittering whistle. As soon as
it became dark a heavy flight of Thrushes and
Warblers started and continued all night. I
heard many T, aliciae among the former. Night.
still , clear, warm.
