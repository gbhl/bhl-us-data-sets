1886
July 23
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and warm.
  Spent the day in the house. Later in the 
afternoon headed down to Great Meadow with 
P. to get the Marsh [?] (C. stellaris) heard
them yesterday.  He was not in the same
place but trying far out in the meadow
I heard him sing over and then call
and then found him in an extension bad
of band I saw -grass. He was very shy and 
I followed him about sometime before
shooting him. Finally I killed him on wing
with my 32 cal. pistol.
  The meadows usually attraction at
sunset, the different colors of the different
birds of grasses being strongly brought out
in the the soft clear light. Hundreds of Swallows
(mostly H. horreorum) were skimming about
and Bobolinks and Red-wings in larger
flocks sealing overheard. Shot on Swift as 
we came up river.
