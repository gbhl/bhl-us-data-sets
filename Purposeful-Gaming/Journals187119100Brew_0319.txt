Blackburnian Warbler singing in the upper branches.
Parulas and Dendroica vireus also abundant here; Canada
Warblers in a swamp below the ridge; Hermits singing
everywhere in the distance. Indigo Birds common. A
single Tanager singing. A Junco heard plainly, twittering
in a brushy opening. No Red-starts and few Red-eyes.
Maryland Yellow-throats abundant in swampy places.
On the way back I spent an hour or more lying on the
bank of a sluggish brook that flows under the road.
Marylands and Song Sparrows singing incessantly. A muskrat
passed me clearing the surface swiftly & rolling great
ripples in among the alders. A Wilson's Thrush singing
and its mate calling. A Black-billed Cuckoo in the
distance.
  Returning to Bailey's house at 4 P.M. I found him at
home and introduced myself. He told me many things about
the birds of this region and quickly found himself a keen and
fairly accurate observer. He has found seven nests of Dend. blackburnian
this season, two with eggs (3 & 4), three with young, two empty.
  We took a walk down the road together and searched a little 
for nests but without success.  Saw a number of Blackburnians.
A young white hare pursued by B's spaniel narrowly escaped B's 
grasp and the next moment darted directly into my hands opened
to receive it. It was a pretty little thing no larger than a small 
kitten; there was a touch of white on the breast and another on
the abdomen. We saw two of these young hares in the road.
  Started for Winchendon at about 6.30 Bailey riding with
me nearly to the town. Found three fine Polyphemus moths 
clinging together on an oak leaf, two [female]s and a [male], one of the
former joined in sexual union with the latter. Hermit Thrushes
numerous and in full song at intervals by the 
roadside. Found H. G. Purdie awaiting me at the hotel, he
having come from Boston by the afternoon train
