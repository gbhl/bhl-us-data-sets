ESKIMOS 139 
Then it often happens that the good, industrious hunter, who 
goes away from the station to provide for his family, receives 
none of the gifts, which are given to the shiftless individuals 
who hang about the station in a state of pious poverty. The 
Moravian Eskimos must provide for themselves by work of one 
kind or another, and the shiftless ones only receive sufficient 
to keep life going, without any of its luxuries. These people 
have all been taught to read and- write, there being a number of 
books printed in the language; the majority of these are of a 
religious character, but there are some on geography, history

a manner which shames, the average white Christian. All are 
exceedingly anxious to learn to read the books printed by the

Great Whale river on the east side of Hudson bay, and from 
cumberland gulf. A great many Eskimos have never come in 
contact with the missionaries; notwithstanding this, there are 
only a few of the Labrador natives who cannot read and write, 
while the natives of baffin island are rapidly reaching the same 
state. Every native who learns to read, and who possesses a 
book, becomes the teacher of the uninstructed; in this manner
