1867
Saturday, January.
  Cloudy all day. Alternately
snowed and rained. Ther. at
6.30 A.M. 32[degrees]; at 3 P.M. 36[degrees]; at
9 P.M. 32[degrees]. Went shooting in
A.M. starting at 6. Saw either 
a ruffed grouse or a quail
fly into the top of a pine tree
and fired into another pine 
tree twice where from the
chickadees I knew there was
an owl but I did not see
him. Saw a blue jay, two gold
finches and several tree sparrows.
Got home at 9.30 A.M. Spent
most of the day at the Nichols'
where we made two snow forts.
Found a gold finch which had
died from hunger under our cedar
tree & the chickadees came into 
the woodshed.

Sunday, January 27.
  Clear but rather windy.
Ther. at 8 A.M. 26[degrees]: at 3 P.M.
about 30[degrees]; at 10 P.M. 20[degrees].
Went to church and sabbath
school in A.M. and was
late to the latter. Mr. M.
preached his first sermon.
Read all P.M. and most
of the evening. In the evening
Mr. Paine came in. Went
to bed at 10 P.M. The snow
has settled considerably but
the crust will not bear yet.
The sleighing is pretty good
although there are many
very bad "cradle holes"
The birds must have a hard
time of it as almost every thing
is covered up.
