MEMORIAL ADDRESSES. 
Since the last meeting at Urbana, death has claimed several 
members of the Illinois Academy of Science, and it is fitting to 
record briefly the lives of these men, several of whom died while 
in the midst of an illustrious career. We are called upon to 
mourn five members who have been thus taken from our number. 
IN MEMORY OF CHARLES REID BARNES. 
BY JOHN M. COULTER. 
The death of Charles Reid Barnes, on February 24, 1910, re- 
moved from the Academy a man whose services in scientific or- 
ganizations have been conspicuous, and who would have proved a 
most efficient member of this young organization. 
His relations to his science were varied and important. He 
was always active in scientific societies, and was held in high 
esteem by his colleagues as an unusually efficient administrator. 
As a teacher he had few equals. There was a clearness and pre- 
cision in his statements, a keen critical sense, an unvarying frank- 
ness, and a winning personality that always attracted and held 
students. For twenty-seven years he was co-editor of the Botan- 
ical Gazette, possessing to an unusual degree the editorial genius, 
which entered into every detail, from general policy to printing. 
As a reviewer he achieved high reputation, for he grasped the 
significant things, and let no doubtful results or inferior work 
slip by without incisive comment. His publications were not 
voluminous, but they include text books, taxonomic work dealing 
with mosses, morphological work dealing with liverworts, and 
critical papers on plant physiology. 
To his comrades in American botany he was more than a com- 
panion in work. He was a loyal friend, whose sweetness and 
largeness of spirit bound them to him in bonds of no common 
strength. The memory of his quiet animation of bearing and 
cheerful vigor will not pass away from the minds of his asso- 
icates. 
The Illinois Academy of Science desires to record upon its 
minutes, along with its deep sense of loss, its gratitude that the 
life of the society has been enriched, even for a short period, 
by the presence of this strong, unsullied, and devoted nature.
