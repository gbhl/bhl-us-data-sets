1890 
Cambridge & Belmont, Mass.
May 2 
Clear and cool with bracing N. to N. E. wind.
Off with Batchelder for the whole day starting
at 8.30 a.m. and getting back at 5.30 P.M.
we went after shrubs and wild flowers for
transplanting and did not attempt to look for
birds but as our way led up through the
swamps and over the Belmont hills by Prospect
St. to the "willows" we saw and heard a
number of species.
Yesterday was wery warm (thur[sday] [?]. 78 [degrees]) and a
Yellow Warbler appeared in our garden. Several
were singing in the fresh Pond swamps as we 
passed this morning. In the same place we
heard two Least Flycatchers and saw eight
or ten Grackles (aves) [?] the latter in the bushy
swamp opposite Barker's.
Over the brook meadows just east of Belmont
a Sparrow Hawk was skimming. It must be 
a settled bird I think.  
Along Prospect St. we heard two Brown Thrashers,
several Mniotilta varia, a single D. [?} and 
numerous Field Sparrows. besides two or three
Grass Fiches.
On Rock Meadow were Red wings in the 
usaul numbers, Swamp Sparrows, Song Sparrows
and a Meadow Lark. A few White-bellied &
barn Swallows (about three or four of each 0 and
two Chimnew Swifts were flying about. A
dozen Crows were carving and circling about
a field on the hill-side beyond the meadow.
B. [Batchelder] tells me he saw as many there one 
day last spring. There was an acre or two
