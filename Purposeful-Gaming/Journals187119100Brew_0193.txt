many places there are thickets of larger blueberry
bushes, alders, Andromeda etc. The soil is damp
and stream with freshly fallen golden birds leaves
beneath which is the usually old leaf would
sect and rotten. The entire place is densely
shaded, damp, and secluded.
  I am sorry that I have neglected this swamp
hitherto for to-day it proved to be filled with birds
not collected into the usual mixed flock but
scattered throughout the entire green, rarely more
than two being found together.
  I shot only a Golden-winged Warbler a 
Water Thrush but a young D. Striata but I saw
a Canada Flycatcher, a Yellow Warbler, a Nashville,
what I am very sure was a Morning Warbler,
a Red start, an Oriole, two Wilson's Thrushes, and
the usual number of Song Sparrows, Cat birds and
other commom species.
  At surreal of these I had good shots but it
was one of my "off-days" and I missed so many
shots that I finally became disgusted and went
hour.
  The only birds heard singing were two G. tricleas
both of which sang one wing.
  While in this swamp I had a most
amusing experience. I was "screeping" in the hope
of calling a Canada Flycatcher where I heard some
animal galloping through the brush directly towards
me and the next moment a fox appeared within
six yards of me, stopped  abruptly, gassed
a moment in perfect bewilderment and then disappeared.
He was of full size but looked lean and mangy.
