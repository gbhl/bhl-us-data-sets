PACIFIC COAST AVIFAUNA No. 3 is the third of a series of publications 
issued by the Cooper Ornithological Club of California for the accommodation of 
papers meriting special consideration, or whose length prohibits their appearance 
in the official organ. 
The publications of the Cooper Ornithological Club consist of two series - 
THE CONDOR, which is the bi-monthly official organ, and the PACIFIC COAST 
AVIFAUNA. Both sets of publications are sent free to honorary members, and to 
active members in good standing.
