A BIBLICAL REMINDER 81 
one who looks on all churches as God's House without 
feeling its effect, and recognising its peculiar fitness 
in Spite of the want of association for him in that 
cloud of incense; and he may even think that he 
has been wrongfully deprived of something desirable 
and of value in his own church service when he 
remembers his Bible, which is perhaps his fetish, and 
the words of the Being he worships, when He pro- 
claimed through the mouth of His prophets that from 
the rising of the sun to its going down incense would 
ascend to Him, morning and evening, in all places. 
Why then is incense not used in the Anglican 
Church, which took its ritual from the church before 
it ? Nobody knows. The histories only tell us that 
it began to fall into disuse in the reign of Edward VI. 
There I will leave the subject, which I confess 
is rather an out-of-the-way one to bring into a 
book concerning the senses of man and animals 
by a field naturalist.
