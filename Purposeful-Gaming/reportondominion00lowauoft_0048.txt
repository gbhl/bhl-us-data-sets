14: CRUISE OF THE NEPTUNE 
coast, to an elevation of upwards of 2,500 feet; far inland is 
seen the glistening white surface of the great Grinnel glacier, 
which flows northward into Frobisher bay. Not being very 
active, it does not discharge icebergs. 
The Saddle-back islands were passed in the evening; they 
number at least twenty, or double the number laid down on the 
chart. There are indications of good harbours between them. 
Soundings taken in the vicinity of the supposed Gripper shoal 
did not indicate any such obstruction to navigation. A large 
number of icebergs were passed during the day, having been 
apparently drifted into the strait by the westerly current of its 
north side, probably aided by favouring easterly winds. They 
were not very numerous to the westward of Big island. 
The morning of the 10th the ship was off Douglas harbour, 
and, from there, coasted along the south side of the strait to 
Cape Weggs, whence a passage was taken for the east end of 
Charles island. The north side of that island was closely fol- 
lowed, in order to Survey it. 
Near the western end of the island many walrus were seen 
in the water and upon a small islet close to the shore. As 
several of these animals were required for dog-food during the 
coming winter, the ship was anchored in a small harbour near 
by, and early next morning the small launch was lowered ready 
for the chase. Soon after leaving the ship, seVeral hundred 
walruses were seen Sporting in the water about the islet. They 
were in bands, varying in numbers from ten to twenty, each 
band probably composed of an old male and his harem. A band 
would be singled out, and the launch, at full speed would put 
after it. When the animals became aware that they were being- 
chased, they would endeavour to escape by diving, always keep- 
ing close together. At first they would remain under several 
minutes, and would travel four hundred yards; as the chase 
became hotter and hotter, the length of the dives gradually
