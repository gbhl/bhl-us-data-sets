accompanied by at least one of the old birds. We
saw the latter tear a large cocoon from under
a rail fence and picking it to pieces remove
the enclosed pupa and breaking these up into
small fragments distribute them among several

mountain and leaving the buggy in a shed

tensive spruce and larch swamp, as well as
in a juniper pasture which skirted the base
of the mountain. The swamp comprised
probably twenty acres. it was covered with
