1886
June 3
Concord, Massachusetts.
Morning rainy. Clearing off cool in the afternoon.
  Spent most of the day in the house; driving to,
and around Fifty Acre Meadow lots in the afternoon.
During this time, I saw a yellow-winged sparrow
perched on a fence post by the roadside and heard
another singing. Both were in sandy sorrel-grown
fields.
