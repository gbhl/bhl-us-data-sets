calendula singing. Along the roadsides, chiefly in
Georgia, we passed at least a dozen Loggerhead
Shrikes and in a cedar in front of a house where
we halted to eat lunch, I discovered a nest of
one of these birds. The female entered it, settled
herself and remained sitting for about ten minutes
then flew down into the road where the male
joined her and fed her with a larger grasshopper,
the [female] quivering her wings and uttering a low
continuous chatter like that of a young bird.
I did not examine the nest but suspect the
bird was laying and had not completed her
set.
  Just as we were entering the outskirts of
Thomasville, I heard the peculiar squaling of
Picus borealis and the next moment discovered
the bird running up the trunk of a small
pine. I did not see one in the Tallahassee
country.
  Carolina Doves were seen at intervals during
the drive usually in pairs, sometimes three together,
in the middle of the road in sandy places.
I heard two males cooing in some low pines, the
first heard this season. No Ground Doves observed.
  Very curiously not a single Sparrow Hawk
was noted during the entire day. I cannot
understand their apparent total absence from
this region.
