once. As we were taking tea, floating idly in 
mid-stream, a Mottled Own began whining in
the distance in the north shore. We heard
another half-a-mile above this point on our 
way home.
  I was convinced by watching the
Red-wings as twilight gathered that a few
of these were preparing to spend the night
in the larger [?] bed but as we passed
it on the way back after dark I saw the
boat into the reeds in two places and
thrashed them with the oars without starting
a single bird. Shortly afterwards I tried
one of the thickets where the Swallows were 
seen settling, with better success, flushing two
from the button bushes.
  There were many green frogs tug[?]ing
to-night and I heard one bull frog.
