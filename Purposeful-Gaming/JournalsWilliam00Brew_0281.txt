1889
April 11
Concord, Massachusetts.
Warm with S.W. wind. Morning clear, clouds gathering
in afternoon & finally obscuring the sun.
  To Concord with Denton by 9 a.m. train. Drove directly
to the Manse and putting my boat in the water started
down river under sail before a strong S.W. breeze. The sun
was shining brightly and the air soft and warm. Song
Sparrows were singing but very curiously I heard no other
birds whatever although we saw Robins, Red-wings (two large
flocks) and many Crows. The river was low for the season
and in most places fairly within its banks although brimfull
and running with a strong current. The Great Meadows
were faintly green and in fine condition for Snipe with
pools of water glistening everywhere among the short grass.
Over their entire extent Leopard Frogs were croaking their
peculiar snoring notes blending into a continuous roll
that swelled and sank as the breeze rose and fell with
sound more characteristic of warm April days on our
Massachusetts marshes. I heard it however, at Tallahassee
last month. The toads have not started yet.
  No large birds except Crows were seen until we passed
Ball's Hill when we came in sight of three Herring Gulls
sitting on a group of tussocks on the edge of the main
channel. They were all adults and looked snow white
presenting a beautiful appearance as they stood in
graceful, easy attitudes occasionally spreading their wings
to the sun. Below them were three Sheldrake (M[ergus] merganser)
two females and a fine old drake. We sailed to within
100 yds. before they flew. As they skimmed off close over
the water, the green head and coral red feet of the drake
were very conspicuous. All the time that we were approaching
