1886
May 31
  Clear and warm with light E. Wind.
Shortly after breakfast I drove to the deserted Esta-
brook farm on the Lince Kilu road and had the 
team return for me at 5 p.m. thus spending the 
entire day in the woods.
  It was a perfect day a little too warm per-
haps in the more sheltered and sunny places,  but
with a cool breeze playing over the open pastures
and drawing down the wood paths.
  Birds sang freely all day, but especially freely 
in the afternoon. I found two nests of Hyduules
ludoviciaua (3. and 4 eggs) four nests of Deudroica Penn-
Sylvanica (3.2.2.2 eggs) and a nest of Spisella Pusilla
(4 eggs) in a singular place in a swampy wood-
lot, raised only a few weeks above the wet ground
amount some Elm Sprouts.
  In this same swamp I heard and saw a 
Mpiaraleus Cimitus in a thicket of bushes spared by
the axe which leveled everything else last minute.
The bird was noisy and shy, as usual and I could
not get within pistol range.
  In an open White Pine grove I came suddenly 
upon a female Grouse with young. Of the latter I saw 
only three. They rain nimbly off a few rods in
different directions, scattering, and squatting out on
the bed of dark pine needles their lighter dead-leaf
tints made them really conspicuous. The hen glided
about in the usual manner whining and growling. 
The cock also appeared and strutted rather slowly
around me chippering like a red squirrel and shak-
ing his head. His tail was raised, his ruffs extended
He neither whined nor crouched, but sun[?] to assume
