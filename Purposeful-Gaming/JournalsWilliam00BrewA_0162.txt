very shy rising at 20 to 30 yds and twice circling out over 
the sea before realighting. It seemed to become suddenly 
aware that we were anxious to get a good view of it 
and had no longer the means of doing it any
injury.
 Both Rani and Finker's Islands are wholly devoid of trees and 
the only shrub I saw on either was a single small 
Rhus typhina but grass and a broad-leaved plant which 
I did not recognise grow luxuriantly wherever there is 
soil enough to support them.  The absence of Savanna 
Sparrows from these islands struck me as their
 most curious feature.  The Sandpipers are much less 
numerous than formerly owing to the persecution they suffer 
at the hands of pic-nickers who land almost daily & 
take all the eggs they can find.  About ten years ago 
the Jeffree's took forty Sandpipers' eggs in one day on 
these islands.
 On the way back we sailed close past Pig Rocks. The
 top of the larger rock was literally covered with Herring Gulls. 
I counted 92 and did not get nearly all. About 75% 
were gray birds, the others apparently in fully adult dress.
  Near the Gulls on a rock at the water's edge sat a
Brant Goose preening its feathers.  I had a good view of
 it through my glass at about 100 yds. It flew when 
the Gulls rose and circled off over the ocean in the 
direction of Marblehead. We saw another bird flying high 
which we took to be a Scoter but could not make out.
 After dinner walked down to Farmer's Pond. A single 
Savanna Sparrow singing on the sand-hills, a Bobolink 
in the mowing field to the westward.  Red-wings in the 
rushes about the pond. Robins running on the wet sand 
of the beach.
