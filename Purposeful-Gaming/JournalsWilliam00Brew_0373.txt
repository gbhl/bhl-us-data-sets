1889
(Sept. 13)
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
I was not prepared and did not fire.
  We landed for lunch about two miles below the forks. 
I took a short walk back into the woods following a
beautiful wood path that led up over a mossy knoll.
Don flushed a Grouse in a windfall. The bird came 
directly by me within ten yards. I shot at it just as
it was disappearing and it went down. But when
I sent Don in for it, it rose again and went into
a tree. I then shot it sitting.

  Starting on we paddled the remainder of the distance
to the forks. The river was low and we had to drag
the boats over some of the shallow places. started
a Great Blue Heron coming suddenly on him within 
20 y[ar]ds and passed a very tame Solitary Sandpiper.
Saw several Sphyrapicus varius, at one place three together. 
Parus hudsonicus numerous. Saw a flock of seven White-winged 
Crossbills. No woodpeckers except one Downy & several Colaptes.
Deer tracks on the sand bar at the forks. No Savannah
Sparrows.

  Started down river at about 4 p.m. reaching the
Mill at about 5.30. The afternoon lights and shadows
very fine. Started two Wood Ducks and saw a few
Robins. No muskrats although their "sign" abounded
everywhere. Reached Lakeside at dark.

Sept. 14
  Cloudy most of the day, the sun occasionally shining
for a few minutes at a time. Wind E. to S.E.
  At 9 a.m. started with Spelman for the Lake House.
Near the mouth of the brook in the lower pond fifteen
Wood Ducks started. I was sailing at the time. 
At Peaslie's brook saw three small Falcons, which I
took to be Pigeon Hawks, playing together alighting,
