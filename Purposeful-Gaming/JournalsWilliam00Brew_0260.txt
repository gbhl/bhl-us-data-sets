numerous and magnolias very abundant & luxuriant.
  Reaching a small pond my driver assured me
I would find Snipe about its edges - a most unlikely
looking place. However I tried it and started
about a dozen bagging seven. There was also a
Bittern and three Carolina Grebes, one of which I
shot (& which proved an adult female laying). The Grebes
uttered the Cuckoo notes & also the Rail-like cry I
ascribed to Gallinule galeata when at Enterprise.
There were also Killdeer & Florida Grackles at this pond.
We spent several hours after this hunting for
Quail driving miles across interminable cotton fields
& patches of brown sedge, the dog starting nothing
but hundreds of Grass Finches, an occasional  Bencaea[?]
and several rabbits, the latter of which he
chased madly. Carolina Doves numerous. A few
Sparrow Hawks & an occasional Marsh Hawk.
Many Savannah & a few Yellow-winged Sparrows.
  Finally we reached another small pond in which
was a female Ring-neck Duck and a Coot feeding near
some tame muscovy ducks. I shot the Ring-neck
and then six Snipe, one more escaping.
  Next to a third pond where we lunched, Eight
Ring-neck Ducks (?) very shy keeping nearly the middle,
a Carolina Grebe, and seven Coots in this pond.
  Spent the afternoon hunting Quail. "Bingo" found
four bevies pointing them all handsomely. Two had
5 birds each, one 6, the last about 18. I killed 11
in 13 shots making four straight doubles. When I
found the last bevy I had only three shells left.
All the bevies were in plum bushes in plantations.
  Drove back to town before sunset. The air sweet
with the fragrance of pines.
