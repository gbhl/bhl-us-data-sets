1887
Sept. 3
MAINE. (L. Umbagog.)
Cloudy all day with light showers at intervals.
  Did not go out at all in the morning but 
after dinner had an exciting sail in the little Rushton.
The wind was N.W. and so strong that the Lake was
covered with white caps. I first ran down to the mouth 
of Cambridge River and then up that stream to the
upper pond. Mr. Skillings, crossing the lower poind at
about the same time, started a Black Duck and
also disturbed some Plover (C. virginicus) which we
both heard whistling.

  On the way back to the Lake I came upon three small
waders running about on the edge of the river. I started
them and made a double on them getting a pair of 
Ereunetis pusillus; the third bird I saw distinctly was
a Tringa minutilla. At about this time a Pigeon Hawk
passed me skimming low over the water. I did not
see it until too late but fired a fruitless shot at 
it at long range.

  Off the mouth of the river after I had set my
sail I ran down on a Whistler getting along but 
by no means impossible shot as it rose. I missed
it apparently.
