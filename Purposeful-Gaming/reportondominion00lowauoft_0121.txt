appearance of vertical fluting, while the weathered tops have a 
castellated finish like that of some gigantic fortress. The cliffs 
fall away abruptly into a long low point of shingle which partly 
closes the mouth of the spacious and safe harbour of Port 
Leopold. 
As we steamed into the harbour what appeared to be an over- 
turned boat with a wooden ' lean-to ' built against it was 
seen at the end of the low point, with a small Danish flag flying. 
The whistle was blown, but no sign of life appeared about the 
place, and thinking that the Magnetic Pole expedition might 
perhaps have met with some disaster and that the survivors 
might be in want, a boat was lowered and the doctor was sent 
ashore with stimulants and warm blankets. Happily his ser- 
vices were not required; the supposed boat proved to be the 
boiler of a steam launch, left here by one of the Franklin search 
parties. Against it were piled a number of cases of provisions 
left a few days previously by the Whaler Windward for the 
Gjoa, and marked by a small flag flying above them. 
The light-coloured limestone forms the bottom of the harbour, 
and gives the water a dangerous looking, light tinge, which is 
quite misleading, as the depth is sufficient for the largest 'ships. 
The east and west sides of the harbour are bounded by high 
cliffs, while at the northern end the land is low, and it is not far 
across it to the bay on the northern coast lying directly west of 
cape Clarence. 
north Somerset has physical characteristics closely resem- 
bling those of North Devon; the limestone cliffs of the northern 
shore, however, appear to be somewhat lower and more broken 
than those of the northern island, while the amount of snow 
and ice of the land is considerably less. The high perpendicular 
cliffs of the east side appear to continue far to the southward
