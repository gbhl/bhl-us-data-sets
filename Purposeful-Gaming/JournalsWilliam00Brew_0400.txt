1889
Oct. 17
A beautiful morning, cloudless, the Lake calm. By 11 a.m. a
strong N.W. wind brought a heavy  pall of clouds over the
sky and the remainder of the day was chilly & gloomy. The
ground froze hard last night.
  We left Lakeside about 9 a.m. and rowed first
around the Sargent Cove. I landed at the Woodcock cove
and beat it carefully but found nothing. Thence we 
kept on along the west shore of the Sweat Cove. I fired
a long flying shot at a Blue Jay but missed. We landed
at the mouth of a little brook to lunch when a Grouse 
started and flew up the hillside rising high among the
trees. I followed and finally discovered her perched
on the horizontal branch of a huge hemlock about
40 ft. above ground. She fell the first victim to the
Damascus barrels of my little 20 gauge.

  Its next victim was a prize, a fine young Goshawk, 
the first I have ever killed. It rose from some drift
wood and alighted on the branch of a tall ash. Jim
paddled me slowly & silently to within 30 yds. & the Hawk
fell dead as I pressed the trigger. He sat very erect and
was a fine, daring looking fellow. A little further on 
a Surf Scoter swam out from the shore & after a few dives
was shot. It was a wing broken "cripple", very thin.

  At "the gut" behind the Great Island I shot a Canada Jay
flying. Not over 100 yds. further on a Black Duck & Great Blue
Heron started out of range. It is singular that the report
had not alarmed them. On the little island where I once
took a Picoides americanus, I discovered a Grouse perched 
among the branches of a birch & shot it. Another flew into
a thicket of spruces where I followed & killed it on the
ground. On reaching camp Charley told us that a
flock of about 25 Geese came into the Lake at 6 p.m. 
yesterday & spent the night off the mouth of the river leaving
at 9 a.m. to-day.
