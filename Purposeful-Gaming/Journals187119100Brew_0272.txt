Concord, Massachusetts.
  C. moved to Concord on the 4th and I followed
to-day driving up from Cambridge late in the 
afternoon. It was cloudy with a chill east wind and 
birds as a rule were silent and close hid. I saw
a fine male Oriole in the road and heard another piping
in an ore heard. Also saw surreal Cat Birds. Lowhees, Chiming
Swifts and Barn Swallow and heard two Thrashers 
singing. Near the ice house above the Waltham crossroads
two Wood Thrashers were singing and I heard another
in the Sandy Pond woods. Saw a rabbit in the road.

  To Boston for the entire day. At day break heard
a Cat-bird, doubter our old friend, singing in
the lilacs at the Manse. Min Emirron saw Orioles on the 4th.

Sunday. The early morning cloudy and cool with E. wind.
  The sun came out at about 11 a.m. and the 
rest of the day was warm and still.
  With the sunshine the birds began singing on every 
side and I quickly found that most of the 
summer species are already here. Orioles, Warbling and
Yellow-Throated Orios, Least Flycatchers, and Cat birds
were heard in every direction from my window for,
with the exception of a short walk on Ripley's Hill, I 
had to spend most of the day in doors writing letters.
  Late in the afternoon, however, I broke my bonds
and taking the Rushton boat rowed up the Assabet
to above Bird's-nest Island. Only the maples and
willows along the bank showed any sign of bears
