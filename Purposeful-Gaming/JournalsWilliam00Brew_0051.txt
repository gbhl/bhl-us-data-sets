1888
May 19
Oden, Michigan
Early morning cloudy. Rest of the day clear [delete]& still[/delete] with strong W. wind. Ther. 46[degrees] in P. M.
  Spent the entire day collecting coming in only for dinner
In the morning crossed the railroad & worked several
hours in the woods beyond. There was a high W. wind
and birds were silent and in the most sheltered places.
We saw very few and heard still fewer singing. I
shot a Lincoln's Finch which started from a fallen
tree top. Dwight saw a single Pigeon flying and later
I came upon a pair in hardwood timber. They flew
from the ground (when they had perhaps been drinking
at a pool of surface water) and alighted in a
beech. I stalked them carefully & got within good
gunshot, but not near enough for the collecting pistol
which I carried, when they took wing and disappeared
flying very swiftly and straight, low down among
the trees.
  On our return the clearing about the house
proved to be alive with birds, chiefly A. palmarum
& D. coronata. I shot a few and after dinner
a good many more. Late in the afternoon took a
fine Zon. leucophrys which appeared on the ploughed
ground in front of the house. Dwight went east
along the railroad for a mile or [?] & shot a
Lincoln's Finch. He heard Thrushes singing which
he took to be Hermits.
  I heard several Grouse to-day & started them
in the open opposite the depot. They were among
some scattered, leafless willows & poplars.
  The woods still leafless. Pussy willows, poplar
catkins & maple blossoms still hanging.
  Bagged just thirty birds to-day.
