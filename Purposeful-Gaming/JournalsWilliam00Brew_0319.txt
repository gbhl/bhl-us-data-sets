1889
June 11
Cambridge, Mass.
Cloudy with heavy showers in the evening. Warm & still.
  At 6 p.m. started for the swamps with Bolles driving
up in a coup√©. Found the Little Black Rail(?) at Pout
Pond singing merrily. Thence across to the Central tracks
where we listened nearly two hours, vainly, for the
big mystery. Faxon joined us at about 7 p.m.
At 8 o'clock we returned to the Pout Pond swamp &
listened an hour to the birds there. The little Rail(?)
singing almost incessantly. Soras and Virginia rails
also very noisy and apparently numerous.
  At  9 p.m. Bolles and I started for West Cambridge
station. As we passed Glacialis bull frogs singing in
numbers. They seem to be practically confined to this
pond though we heard one at Pout Pond.
  The little Rail(?) singing incessantly on Alwife Brook
in the marsh between the railroads. A single Sora
singing in the meadow east of this brook. The
marshes about the Maple Swamp and the entire
Brickyard Swamp apparently harbor no Rails this
year. We did not hear one them this evening.
