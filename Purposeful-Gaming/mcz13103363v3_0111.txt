Tuesday, July 30.
  Clear and a most beautiful
day and quite cool for the
season. Ther about 65 [degrees]���
75 [degrees]���64 [degrees]. Rose at the
usual time & at first we planned
to start for the Mountains
in the 12 train but finally
decided not to go till to-morrow.
Loafed round most of the A.M.
and found that the cat had got
into the pigeon house & killed
a number of the pigeons.
In the P.M. killed a young
warbling vireo with my blow
gun beside many bumble
bees. Went up to the Deane's but
Ruth had not got home. Went
up to the Nichols after supper
to see about their going into Boston
to-morrow morning.
