into the wood path and  I saw that he had horns.
He stopped at about 60 yds. distance and stood
facing me in such a way that I could see only a 
small patch of his breast and fore shoulder, through 
the branches that intervened. I aimed carefully at
this mark & fired. The animal sprang forward at
once and passed me going at a furious pace and
quickly disappearing in the brush. I went to the
spot where he had stood and finding no blood
concluded that I had missed but after waiting a while
decided to follow his tracks. Only a few rods beyond
where I lost sight of him I came upon him stone
dead, his legs doubled up under him, his graceful
head and horns lying stretched out on the pine needles
that carpeted the ground. He was shot in the middle
of the chest. The ball traversed the whole length of the
body and I cut it out of the back side of the 
haunch.
  In the afternoon we drove around to the lighthouse.
Started the bevy of Quail among the turnips but they rose
out of range & took to the park.  Followed them getting
several hard brush shots Cory killing the only bird -
shot three hares one of which, a "cony", fell to my gun.
Beat the scrub east of the pigeon houses for Eng. Pheasants
and drove one across a path about 100 yds. ahead of
H. I afterwards found it but took it for a hare as
it scuttled off over the ground not discovering my mistake
until it rose when I shot at but missed it.
Started a Great Blue Heron in the woods. Saw many
hares, all in brown pelage. Shot one with the rifle
this morning
