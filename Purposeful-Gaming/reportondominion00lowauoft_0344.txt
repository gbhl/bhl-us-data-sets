232 CRUISE OF THE NEPTUNE 
From a study of the different sets of glacial striae, Tyrrell 
concluded that the centre of glaciation was, in the early part of 
the glacial period, somewhere to the north and west of the head 
of Chesterfield inlet; that later, when the ice increased in thick- 
ness, the centre of dispersion moved to a position southwest of 
Baker lake; while as the glacier diminished the centre moved 
nearer the seashore, and the final stage was probably repre- 
sented by the ice-cap breaking up into a number of distinct 
glaciers, each with local movement of its own. 
These conclusions of Tyrrell as to the southern movement of 
the centre of glaciation are borne out by the writer's observa- 
tions of the striae along the shores of Roes Welcome, where as 
many as six sets of striae were found at Whale point, the usual 
number being three. The oldest set, found only at Whale point, 
showed that the ice movement was from the northwest. The 
next in age were from N. 50 e., or almost at right angles to 
the oldest; following in order of age come striae from N. 25 
e., n., n. 30 W., and N.W. The last three sets are found in 
a number of places between Winchester inlet and Whale point; 
the others only at Whale point. The direction of the above sets 
of striae apparently shows that the earliest accumulation of ice 
in the region north of the western side of Hudson bay was some- 
where to the northwest; this was followed by an abrupt change 
in the ice-movement, which was next from almost northeast, 
after which the centre of movement of the ice-cap gradually 
shifted, by way of north, to northwest. It would also appear 
that the centres of dispersion were much greater in area than 
the limits placed upon them by Tyrrell. 
This southern movement of the centre of dispersion of the 
ice is diametrically opposite to what occurred in the case of the 
ice-cap of Labrador, where the striae along the east side of Hud- 
son bay show that the centre of ice-movement changed from a 
position near the central area of the peninsula, a short distance
