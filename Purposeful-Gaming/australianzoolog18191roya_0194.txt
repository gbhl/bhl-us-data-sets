forms a cloud, settling over the object. After secretion of the substance, the male 
swims forwards, away from it. Although we have no direct proof of its function,

Fig. 3. Platypus eggs in nest. This photograph was taken on Day 113 (13 November 1971) 
while the female was in the exhibition tank. The only disturbance involved was 
removal of the lid of the nesting box and the placing of two pieces of card (handled 
with surgical gloves and forceps) alongside the eggs. The three compartments of 
the nesting box are connected by small apertures to form an S-shaped chamber 
with a single entrance (out of sight) at the lower left of the photograph.
