  Wend over my usual ground but began at
the upper end and finished at the lower, coming 
out at the Lince Kulu.  
  Met two large mixed flocks, the first in oak
woods containing about 50 birds, among them
about 8 Chickadees, 2 D. Pennsylvanica, 2 D. Vireos,
6 D. Striata, 1 D. Caerulescens, 1 Setophaga, 2 Nashville
Warblers and a Tanager (ad [male] changing plumage)
the other flock was in the larger white pine woods
and contained about 10 Robins, 10 Chickadees, 6
Nashville Warblers, 4 Yellow-rumped Warblers, two
D. Vireos, Sitta Canadensis and a few Red-eyes.
There were also birds scattered about everywhere, 
snugly and in little parties of two to five
or six. Evidently a heavy flight of migrants
came in from the North last night. The
increase in Black-polls was especially weeked;
they were really numerous to-day for the first time.
  I had particularly good luck missing few
shots and bagging twelve birds, all fine specimens.
The proven of ten day was the Tanager above
referred to. I also killed an E. flavicentris (not
mentioned above).

was delightful, the air cool and bracing, the 
sunshine warm and mellow, the sky a deep
