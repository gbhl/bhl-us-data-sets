1886
July 6
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and intensely hot (ther. 103 in the shade)
  In the morning drove to the ice pond to
get the solitary Vireo nest. To my disgust it
was empty and apparently deserted, the birds
gone. It looked not quite finished and was
probably abandoned the day I found it.

    From here we drove to Smith's and back
by the wood road under Annersnack. The heat
in sheltered places along the wood edges was 
simply stifling. Yet Birds sang rather freely
considering the [?] of the season. I heard
D. virens, M. meloda, Setophaga, Pyranga, and 
immeasurable Red-eyed Vireos.

  Late in the afternoon Deane and I 
sailed down river to the meadow below Dakin's
Hill. While he was botanizing in the meadow
I heard a Henslow's Sparrow singing near the 
upper end and going in pursuit found it
perched on a tall stalk of rue (Thalictrusea). 
It was rather sly and made several flights 
before I finally shot it.
  In the field bordering "Hermit's Pond" I heard
a Yellow-winged Sparrow singing steadily and 
vigorously. I believe I heard one in the same
place earlier in the season.

  Swallows were out in great force this 
evening over the river The Barn and White bellies feeding
broods of young. The air was full of them at 
times and I must have seen over a hundred
There were many Red-wings in flocks also
Wild rice (Lizamia) in bloom and forming great beds in 
The shallow water along the river and islands
