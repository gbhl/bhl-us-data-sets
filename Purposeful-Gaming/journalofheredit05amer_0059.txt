SECOND GENERATION FROM CROSS. 
This is another specimen of the second generation cross between Connecticut Havana and 
Imported Sumatra. It bore 30 leaves with short internodes, and was, therefore, a close 
approximation to the desired result, combining the large number of leaves of the Sumatra 
type with the large size of leaves of the Havana variety. Its contrast with the plant 
shown in the preceding plate, however, vividly shows the wide diversity of forms pro- 
duced when segregation of characters takes place. (Figure 20.)
