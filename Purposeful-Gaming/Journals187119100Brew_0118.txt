1886
July 11 (Sunday)
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and cool with blustering N.W. wind.
  Leaving the Mause at 3 P.M. in my canoe
I sailed to Fairhaven Bay landing at Cranston and
starting back at sunset.

  The river meadows above the Friends farm were 
alive with Swallows, chiefly Cotile with a fair number
of Barn Swallows, several Cliff Swallows and 
White-bellies and an occasional Martin. The 
Barn Swallows were finding their woods on dead
branches (usually of the button bush) one this time.
The Bank Swallows do not need to have this
habit, All that I see are in the air or perched
on telegraph wires. I think they find their young
on wing chiefly, if not exclusively. I saw at least
two hundred in our great flock or swarm, circling
about, chattering, and making a great show and noise.

  In the meadow opposite the Hubbard farm a 
Henslow's Sparrow was singing steadily as I passed
on the way up rise (about 4 P.M.) and desultorily as 
I came back (7:30 P.M.). Its is stranger that I 
did not find him when there on June 9 for I 
spent the entire forenoon and beat the ground
closely marching for Bobolinks' nests. Both this 
species and C. Passerella deem to sing more freely in
July then in May or June. I hear a passerella
just below Fairhaven opposite the Cliffs.

  Pink lilies below Fairhaven; very unlike the white,
with outer petals not in the least green but deep
brownish pink, inner ones faintly pink.

Maryland Yellow Warbler, Song Sparrow, a [?], and 2 Larks.
