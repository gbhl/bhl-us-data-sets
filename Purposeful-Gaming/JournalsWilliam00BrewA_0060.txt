flapped their broad wings lushly as the clung to
the leaves of the magnolias.  Several times a 
Swallow-tailed Kite glided past just about the

Warblers in their [?] for they chiefly haunted  
the deciduous oaks on which the leaves were just
beginning to unfold the trees having that 
delicate salmon pink tinge seen in one [?]
oaks at the corresponding season.  The Warblers fed

After lunching with the Doctor our canoes 
floating side by side I started down [?]

overtook the scow which had anchored at 
a sandy beach at a landing on the east bank.
The time was very beautiful most of the

and two Swallow tailed Kites.  One of the 
latter went through the beautiful diving 
evolution.  Also saw a flock of several Red-billed 
Greebes.
After skinning my birds we pushed off then
scow floated down [?] half a wish a 
[?] and tied up for the suplis to the west 
bank.  Saw about forty Black Juthuis? after 
it had been in mostly dark roosting In the 
top of a tall dead tree.  A few Barred Owls
hooting in the distance.
