shore-ice. During the past voyage of the Neptune many walrus 
were seen; the most northern locality was at the entrance to 
Smith sound, where large numbers were congregated on pans of 
floating ice, between Etah and Cape Sabine. Numbers were 
seen along the coast of Ellesmere island and in the waters of 
Lancaster sound. The whalers and natives report them as very 
plentiful in Wellington channel. They are common along the 
coast of Baffin island, a considerable number being killed an- 
nually at the station at Cape Haven, and in Cumberland gulf. 
They are very numerous in Fox channel and Frozen strait, 
where they are captured while on the floating ice usually found 
in these localities throughout the summer. When the ice leaves 
Hudson bay and Hudson strait, the walrus resort to favourite 
localities, usually small rocky islands, where they are frequently 
found in large numbers. Such islands are located in King 
sound, near Douglas harbour, on the south side of the strait; at 
the west end of Charles island, also in the strait; at Walrus 
island in Fisher strait, and at several small islands of the 
Belcher and other outer islands of the east coast of Hudson bay. 
When the St. Lawrence was discovered the walrus was found 
as far south as the Magdalen islands, and, within a compara- 
tively recent time, they were common on the Atlantic coast of 
Labrador; now they are only killed rarely at Cape Chidley, the 
northern point of that coast. On Hudson bay they were 
formerly found as far south as Paint islands on the east 
side of James bay, but now they do not frequent that coast 
south of latitude 60 N"., and their southern limit is about lati- 
tude 57 N"., on the Belcher islands. There has been a rapid 
diminution in the number of walrus in the northern part of the 
bay during the past few years, since the Active has been 
engaged in their capture, and it is only a question of a few 
years, if the present methods of killing are continued, before 
the walrus will become as rare as the Right whale in the waters
