1886
June 26
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Confined to the house by tonsillitis since the 
21st. Three days of cloudy lowering weather with
more or less rain. Birds about the Mause in
full song during this period, the Robins especially
prominent, the Orioles least so.
  The sure rose clear to-day and at noon it was
very hot but with a fresh W. wind. At day break
thru was a full chorus of bird voices. I have not
heard them sing so vigorously for three weeks
past. They kept it up, too, almost without inter-
mission until high noon.
  In the early forenoon I took a drive to
Robbin's Mill and back by way of the Parker Lot
and Smiths. Birds singing everywhere in 
the woods and fields although the sun was so
scorching and the air, even in the shade, sultry.
  Field Sparrows, Grass Firches, our Wood Thrush,
Red-Eyed Vireo in countless numbers. Chestnut-
Sided Warbles, Yellow throated Vireos; Our solitary
Vireo in pine woods by the pond below Smiths,
Song Sparrows, Cat Birds, Orioles everything in
fact that the country here affords, except Brown
Thrashers and Nashville Warblers, both of which
seem to have become entirely silent.
