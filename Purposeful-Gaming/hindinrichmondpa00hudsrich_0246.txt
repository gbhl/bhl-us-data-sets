226 A CRAZY NOTION 
that it is so because of the effect of the motion of 
the earth revolving on its axis from west to east. 
This strikes me as about the craziest notion ever 
hatched from the brain of a scientist. For if this 
motion affects us, why not the other one of the earth's 
revolution round the sun, and that still other motion 
of our planetary system through space? They may 
all affect us, but I don't want to think of it. That 
way madness lies.
