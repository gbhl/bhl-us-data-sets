(June 4)  
apparently not high enough for C.Palustris or rather
they are nearly submerged by the water which
has been swollen by the recent rains so that it
is over the meadows in many places.
  As I was paddling into Fairhaven hugging the
wooded eastern shore I heard a crackling of leaves &[and]
twigs and soon spied a large woodchuck rambling
about in the woods moving rather swiftly with a gliding
motion waving his tail at each step. I often see them
thus in the depths of the woods.
  Landed on the north side of Fairhaven and struck
through the woods (tangled oak scrub) towards the Hermit
Thrush locality. Soon found a wood path and almost
immediately heard two Hermits singing in the distance.
The path led directly towards them and when I reached
the nearest I found myself on the very spot (by a gound
pine) where with Mr. Hose and Purdie I heard them
last in 1886. The evening, too, (it was 6 o'clock) was
previously similar and it was hard to realise that it was
not the same occasion with the intervening months blotted
out. The one I approached ceased singing when I was
fifty yards away when the other stopped also. I waited
sometime then returned to the Bay. The Thrush I heard
most distinctly was a superb singer. No other bird that
I have ever heard equals the Hermit. The locality is
a burnt ground with mossy openings - very like a northern
(Maine) barren.
  Near the river several Vireos and a Wood Thrush, the
latter's song very commonplace after the Hermit. As I
sailed down stream I caught several of the Hermit"s
higher notes through breaks in the high ridge on the
eastern side. Shot two Swallows below the Cliff and reached
the house at 8 p.m.
