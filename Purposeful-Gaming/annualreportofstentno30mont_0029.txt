THIRTIETH REPORT OF THE STATE ENTOMOLOGIST 29 
teer sweet clover, secondary honey and pollen plants, and protec- 
tion from prevailing winds. Further, beyond the generalities that 
sweet clover is our main honey plant, and that it requires mois- 
ture and favorable soil, no absolute evaluation of any of the sup- 
posed limiting factors in relation to the whole has been possible 
for any area during any particular year. The use of irrigation 
maps, weather records, Agricultural Census statistics of legume 
hay and seed crops, apiary registration records, and information 
on physiography has enabled the State Apiarist to select unused 
beekeeping territory with a high degree of success. Where com- 
binations of favorable factors have been found, commercial opera- 
tors have almost invariably confirmed the conclusions by examin- 
ing the territory and putting it into production. There has been 
only one definite failure and this was attributed to a factor not 
found in any other area. Though it is too early to draw definite 
conclusions, the methods applied have resulted in the location of 
thousands of colonies of bees and the production of approximately 
1,000,000 pounds of honey and 20,000 pounds of beeswax in 1944.
