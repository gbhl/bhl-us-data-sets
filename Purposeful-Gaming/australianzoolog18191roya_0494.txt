twice as wide distally as proximally. The merus is slender, 7.5 times longer than 
wide and slightly shorter than the chela. The ischium is short, 0.4 of the length 
of the merus and feebly setose along the medial border. The basis is 1.1 times 
the length of the ischium and is also sparsely setose medially. The coxa is more 
robust, with a small setose ventro-medial process. 
The second pereiopods are subequal and similar. The carpocerite is exceeded 
by the carpus and chela. The palm of the chela is about 2.5 times longer than 
wide, feebly compressed and slightly tapering distally. The fingers are slightly 
bowed and a little shorter than the palm length. The tips are hooked and the 
cutting edges straight and entire. The carpus is short and stout, 0.6 of the palm 
length, moderately expanded distally and unarmed. The merus and ischium are 
also unarmed, the merus subequal to the palm length and 5.5 times longer than 
wide, the ischium more slender, subequal in length to the merus and 6.0 times 
longer than wide. 
The ambulatory pereiopods are slender, the third exceeding the basicerite by 
dactyl, propod and carpus. The dactylus is slender and curved, about 4.0 times 
longer than the width at the base. The unguis is slender, equal to 0.6 of the 
length of the corpus, which bears a stout distal accessory spine. Sensory setae 
are present disto-laterally. The propod is about 10 times longer than wide, with 
5-6 ventral spines. The carpus is 0.6 of the propod length and the merus is 
subequal; both are without spines. The fourth and fifth pereiopods are similar 
but longer, the ratios of the segments being, in the dissected female specimen: 
P3 P4 P5 
Propod 35 39 45 
Carpus 23 23 25 
Merus 35 43 52 
The pleopods are normal. The appendices internae of the ovigerous female 
are very well developed. The appendix masculina bears numerous long spiniform 
setae. 
The uropods are normal. The protopodite is without a postero-lateral spine. 
The exopod is broad, 2.6 times longer than wide, with the lateral margin straight, 
setose, terminating in an acute tooth distally, with a strong mobile spine medially. 
The endopod is about 3.4 times longer than broad and falls short of the end 
of the exopod. 
TYPES: 
Bate's specimens are preserved in the collections of the British Museum 
(Natural History). His description and figure 5 are based on the female specimen, 
with a rostral dentition of 9/2. This specimen is now in a fragmented state. The 
carapace is detached from the cephalothorax, which is also separated from the 
abdomen. The mouthparts, except the third right maxilliped, the eyes and the 
antennae are detached, but all pereiopods are still attached to the cephalothorax.
