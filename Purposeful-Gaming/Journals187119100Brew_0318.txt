1887 
June 25
Winchendon, Worcester Co., Mass.
Clear and rather cool with high N. wind
  Started from town at 7 a.m. taking the Garden road for
Charles Bailey's. Upon reaching his home I found it locked
and vacant save for a little brown spaniel who barked at me
when I knocked. At the next farm when I left my horse
I was told that Bailey had gone trout fishing but this proved

covered with a dense growth of spruces and balsams, and up
a hillside opposite. Struck into the swamp on the right but
found it to dense as to be almost impenetrable, the spruces 
and balsams growing almost in masses, the ground beneath
pretty clear of brush or weeds and carpeted with sphagnum in
the wet places. Paths and droppings of white hares everywhere.
Nothing wanting but arbor-vitae to make the place precisely

  In this swamp Blackburnian and Canada Warblers were
abundant and I heard at least three Black & Yellow Warblers.
I found the nest of a pair of Solitary vireos. The [male] was singing 
just above it and the [female] quietly sitting in it but a moment 
later she flew & I saw that it was empty and
unfinished. Several Song Sparrows singing here had peculiarly
harsh, wild voices.
  Beyond the swamp the country changed. The road led
fist through pine woods then into a fine forest of oaks
(L. rubra exclusively), maples, and birches, open underneath
and reminding me strongly of the woods about the
Mirriam's p[?] in Lewis Co., New York. There were a few
spruces intermingled with the hardwoods, some of them
tall and shapely. Each was nearly sure to have a
