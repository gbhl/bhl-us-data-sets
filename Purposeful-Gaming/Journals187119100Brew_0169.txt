non showed themselves. In the very place when I 
shot the Marsh [?] on my way up another was now
in full song. I landed, shot at, and probably missed
him as well as two others which bobbed up into the
tops of the grass and dropped again when I find a fourth
I killed and found it to be a young bird in first pl.

  Returning to the boat I heard a C. palustris singing on 
the opposite shore when I also noticed several fallen
nests of this species. Our hooting the bird I found it
 a nearly worthless species, wilting and ragged.
  Opposite the worth of Pantry Brook I shot a third
C. Stellaris and a female Bobolink in full breeding plumage
A Marsh [?] was singing in the meadow to the 
nest but I did not try for him. I however shot
a Cliff Swallow, which with several others and many
Barn Swallows, was bathing in the river, bird 
after bird striking the smooth, rose-[?] surface
in quick succession making innumerable sing like
fish rising:
  From the bridge to Fairhaven I was interested in
watching the great flight of Swallows passing over 
up river. The scattering ones flew low down but the 
bulk passed in thru great flocks on Swallows higher 
in air. Nearly all well Barn Swallows.

  As I crossed the baby in the twilight Wood Pines
worn singing in the woods, a Wilson's Thrush called a 
few times, and two Maryland Yellow-Throats sang
their flight son. Nothing else except Kingbirds twittering.
A little later (7.15) a Whippoorwill began and
sang for a few minutes. After that I a lowed home.
I heard only a few green frogs and innumerable crickets. No 
Warblers migrating to-night.
