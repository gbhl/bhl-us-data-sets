Monday, July 5, 1869.
  Clear but deliciously
cool. Ther. about 60[degrees] - 
70[degrees] - 60[degrees]. Rose as
usual. Spent most
of the A.M. near
the river digging
for mole crickets &
trying to shoot a
Martin but succeeded
in neither attempt
although I managed
to get a male Yl. Wing
Sparrow. In the P.M.
went out again
but did not shoot
anything. Caught
a number of insects.
In the evening went to
a picnic at egg rock,
& had a very good time.
Was introduced to Miss
Edith Davidson among
others, who is very
pretty. Took Miss Wheeler
home in our boat.

Had a very bad attack
of the reuhmatism

almost laid me up.
Managed however to
shoot another Yl. Wng.
Sparrow while Dan
was picking strawberries.
Took the 1.30 train
home, coming down
with Dan, Cy Hubbard,
and Ed. Simmons.
Dan & Cy. were going
to N. Andover to get
Shad spawn.
Took the horse car at
Porter's and got home
about 5 P.M. In P.M.
mounted one sparrow &
made a skin of the other.
