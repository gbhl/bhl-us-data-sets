A MERRY BROWN THRASHER. 
BY DR. J. HOLBROOK SHAW. 
A Harporhynchus rufus 
Sat in a quircus tree, 
And as he closed one optic 
Said, in song of course, to me; 
'"In assuming the prerogative 
Of a highly cultured race 
To apply succinct appelatives. 
And assign to each his place. 
You can scarcely call it delicate 
To refer directly to 
My romanesque probosis 
And my Titian tinted hue."
