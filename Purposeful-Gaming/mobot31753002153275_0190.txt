28 AMERICAN FERN JOURNAL 
Herbarium, we are all under great obligation for their 
painstaking efforts on behalf of the Society during the 
past year. We are particularly indebted also to Pro- 
fessor Winslow, not only for mailing current issues of 
the Journal but for storing back numbers and success- 
fully soliciting the sale of sets. Storage and mailing are 
a burden which he has borne patiently for many years 
and of which he should be relieved in some way during 
the coming year. 
Owing to ill health, Mr. Burnham, Secretary for the 
past four years, has found it necessary to retire from 
active participation in the affairs of the Society at the 
close of this year. To him are extended the sincere 
thanks of the members for his faithful and efficient ser- 
vices. 
Respectfully submitted, 
WILLIAM R. MAXON, 
President
