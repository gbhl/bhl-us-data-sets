Monday, March 25, 1867.
  Cloudy all day. Rained
hard all A.M. and first
part of P.M. but did not
settle the snow as much as
might be expected. Ther. about
36[degrees] - 40[degrees] - 36[degrees]. The walking
to-day was wretched.
In the P.M. rode down
town in the Horse Car, bought
two pounds of paint & ordered
a box for softening old bird skins
to be made. When I home
began an artificial rock. Then
went up to the Nichols' with
C. Carter whom I met. In the
evening worked my Latin out
at home as the lesson was short
but I did not make much sense out of
it. The snow drops are all up
where the snow is off.
Tuesday, March 26, 1867.
Clear and a beautiful day.
Ther. 34[degrees] - 40[degrees] - 27[degrees].
The snow melted considerably
in the middle of the day.
In P.M. went shooting up to
'the pond' and from thence
to the 'Feeding grounds'. As  
I passed R. Deane's house he
joined me. We saw two song sparrows,
two redpolls, and a gull flying
over 'the pond'. All the P.M.
we saw crows in fours & fives
or single, but all flying directly
Northward: we must have seen
forty or fifty thus engaged.
R. Deane shot a red squirrel.
Got home at 5.40 P.M. In the
evening went up to the R's.
The grass is getting green in sheltered
places free from snow.
