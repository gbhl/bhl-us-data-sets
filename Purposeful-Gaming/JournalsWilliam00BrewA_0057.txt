1890
March 22
Suwanee River, Florida.
Alternately cloudy and clear. Wind strong from S.W.
Rained heavily through the night.
  Started out after breakfast taking my canoe and
paddling up river about 300 yds. landed on the
west bank. It was a bad day for birds and I
found but few there in the tops of the tallest
trees as a rule. Saw a Water Thrush, probably
S. notabilis. Chapman shot a Swainson's Warbler and
after joining me started and killed another
on the ground where I had been spending
most of the morning. I got absolutely nothing
save a few Parulas. The locality was a cypress 
swamp separated from the river by a narrow
ridge of hard ground wooded with oaks and
hack berry(?) trees. There were a few [?] (all
erythropthalmus) Brown Thrashers and Cardinals
near the river & many Parulas in the tree tops.
  After dinner crossed the river and tried
the swamp on the other (east) bank. As I 
entered it I heard Blackbirds singing in medley
 - a great troop of them. Found Red-wings,
Florida Grackles and [Rustins?] about equally
represented in the flock. Killed two Rustins at 
one shot. Saw a Winter Wren which plunged into
a fallen tree top & disappeared. Next came on
a very large flock of Warblers fully 100 chiefly
Parulas with a good many Yellow-[?] , one
Prairie, some Gnatcatchers and a Red-eye or two.
After following them for some time I picked 
out and shot a [male] Bachman's. Chapman &
du Bose then came up. They had killed
two Bachman's. We went on together and
