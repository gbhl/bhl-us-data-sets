Saturday, September 11, 1869.
  Clear but windy.
Ther. about 60[degrees] - 65[degrees] - 
64[degrees]. Rose as usual.
H. Henshaw came
up at about 9 A.M.
and I went out on the
farm with him. We
walked only a short
distance as I felt very
weak, and shot each
of us three Autumnals.
I took also several but-
terflies. After getting home
made skins of our birds.
I also skinned a Mole that
I found. H. left at about
4 P.M. Then had Tiger
harnessed and rode
around Fresh pond and
talked for some time with
R. Deane who had just
put his boat on.
Dendroica Striata, shot
three and saw numbers.
Sunday, September 12, 1869.
  Clear and pleasant.
Ther. about 65[degrees] - 70[degrees] - 68[degrees].
Rose as usual, with severe
in my bowels and in
great suffering. Took
rhubarb several times
but with no good effects.
In P.M. had Dr. Osmar
Summoned, who gave
me laudnum and
this quieted me.
Slept most of P.M.
