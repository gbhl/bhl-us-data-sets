1890
June 8
Cambridge, Belmont, Waltham & Lexington, Mass
Pout Pond Swamp
Sky without a cloud all day; air clean & sparkling; wind
strong and cold from the N.W.
to Port Pond swamp with Spelman at 8 a.m. taking
our cameras and spending an hour or more photographing
the Least Bittern's nest found on the 6th. I took up four
brown eggs (a set from Detroit) and placed them in the nest.
After taking a number of views I cut off the supporting 
cat-tails at the water line and got the nest home in
very good condition.
The Gallinules seemed to be very curious and somewhat
anxious about the object of our visit. We heard them a
great many times very near us & always near the dead elm.
When we remained still for some time they would approach
nearer (sometimes within 2 yds.) giving the [?] water and
a short, nasal uh. We did not get a sight at either of them.
I think they are preparing another nest very near the elm.
We also heard one of the other pair just east of the
causeway as we [?] their stronghold.
Virginia Rails were rather noisy this morning several giving
the pig-note. We heard our Carolina whinney but no er-e.
Found a curious nest among cat-tails placed on the mud
but built up four or five inches above the water and constructed
entirely of dead bleached cat-tails. It resembled a Gallinules
in materials, construction and position but was not more
than half as large. I think it must have been a Virginia Rail's.
I put the Least Bitten's eggs in it and then photographed it.
We returned at 10.30 driving back in a coupe.
Drove through Belmont, Waltham & Lexington
Off again at 4.30pm driving to the Lyman place, [?]
around Shurman's Pond and home by way of the Willows.
