1888
April 18
Cambridge, Massachusetts
Cloudy with heavy showers at intervals
  To the Fresh Pond marshes at 9 A.M., driving
up, and walking back after spending the forenoon
there. The weather was wild and windy and birds,
albeit numerous, were not singing freely. Nevertheless I
heard many Swamp Sparrows and Tree Sparrows, a
Flicker, one Red-wing (only two seen) and numerous
Song Sparrows.
  I first explored the maple swamp finding a Robin
or two, several Song Sparrows and a Swamp Sparrow or
two. A Yellow-rump flew overhead but did not alight.
A single Red-wing singing on a maple. Two Rusty Blkbirds
and five Cow Birds seen flying. Spent nearly an hour
without getting a shot at anything. A few hylas
and marsh frogs piping.
  Pushing through the middle of the swamp I next entered
the meadow that separates it on the north from the F.R.R.
Several Swamp Sparrows here. Saw a yellow Red-poll (hypochrysa)
and started a Snipe twice, the latter bird very wild.
  In a briary thicket along a ditch shot two Virginia Rails.
One wounded by my first shot gave me a long chase
running like a mouse from tussuck to root. Shot at
it four times in all before killing it. Both Rails silent,
one perched in bushes a few inches over the water.
  As I was leaving this meadow three gunners entered it
working a spa[?] & evidently looking for Snipe. I
afterwards heard them fire four or five shot in the
meadows to the westward. All these meadows were
in excellent condition for Snipe, the frost all out,
the water about right, the grass already green in places.
  Following the railroad back I entered the brickyard
