the infected part. This must be done promptly. all 
diseased branches and trees, if badly attacked. should be 
cut out and burned at once. As a matter of fa.t, quinces 
are not ordinarily attacked in the limbs or on the trunks, 
so that the removal of the twigs or small branches often 
cuts out the diseased portions. 
The stem of the Quince tree is attacked by borers, 
which can be controlled only by digging them out. 
The fruit is attacked by codlin moth; this is best treated 
with arsenical poisons applied in spray form. The 
Quince curculio is often very troublesome, causing the 
fruits to become knotty. The best remedy is to catch 
the insects by the jarring method (Fig. 2059), as the 
plum curculio is caught. 
comparatively few varieties have been added to Quince 
lists in recent years. Bailey says in his bulletin on " The 
Quince in Western New York" (Bulletin 80 of cornell 
Experiment Station), which appears to be the only 
experiment station publication on this subject, that 
Orange, Champion, Rea and Meech are the leading 
varieties in New York state. Among the newer varie- 
ties. fuller and Van Deman should be mentioned. With 
Quinces, as with other fruits for which there is not a 
strong and constant demand, it is desirable to plant

carefully. It usually pays to grade the fruit, which may 
be shipped according to quality in peck or 15-pound 
grape baskets, in bushel kegs, half barrels or barrels. 
The liner grades are ordinarily marketed with greatest 
profit in the smaller packages. 
Quinces are propagated in four ways: (1) cuttings 
of the ripened wood and also from pieces of roots treated 
like cuttings; (2) mound layers; (3) root-grafting; 
(4) budding. Hardwood cuttings are employed by 
nurserymen who have light, warm soils. They are 
handled like grape cuttings, and made like currant 
cuttings. In mound-layering the old plant is cut 
back to encourage a growth of sprouts from the crown. 
A mound of soil is thrown about them. When rooted 
they are detached. Layer-grown plants are not the most 
desirable because much given to sprouting when set in 
the orchard. when root-grafting is employed, pieces 
of apple roots are spliced to the cions. These roots 
assist the cuttings in becoming established, and often 
are removed when the nursery tree is transplanted at 
one or two years, or perhaps not till prepared for orchard 
setting. Quince stock is used when trees are propagated 
by budding. Angers is commonly grown from seed for 
this purpose. JOHN craig.

this includes the rangoon creeper, a tender woody 
plant with 5-petaled red fls., remarkable for their ex- 
tremely long calyx-tube (2-3 in.), which is slender and 
green and at first sight might be mistaken for a pedicel 
or corolla-tube. the name quisqualis means literally 
who? what? and was given by rumphius in astonish 
ment at the plant's behavior, for it is said to grow erect 
and shrub-like to a height of 3 ft when it throws out 
from the base a new growth that climbs up the neigh 
boring trees, after which the original shrub perishes. 
Many other interesting statements about this plant are 
made in b.m. 2033. 
Quisqualis is a genus of 4 species native to tropical 
Asia, Natal, Madagascar and Guinea. Lvs. mostly 
opposite or nearly so, oblong or ovate, acuminate, en- 
tire: fis. changeable in color, white to red; stamens 10; 
ovary 1-celled; ovules 3-4; fr. dry, oblong, leathery, 
5-cornered, 5-winged, l-seeded.

nearly glabrous: calyx-teeth triangular, acute, not acu-

angles but hardly winged. Malaya. Widely cult, in 
tropics. B.M. 2033. B.R. 6:492. R.H. 1868:50 (as 
Q, pubescens).-quisqualis indica is cult, in northern 
hothouses. For best results it should be planted in beds 
of soil composed of fibrous loam, peat and sand. The fls. 
appear from June to September, and last well when cut. 
After flowering the plant should be cut back severely and 
water applied less frequently until the wood is ripened. 
New growth starts the following spring. If the plant is 
kept in a very hot and humid atmosphere it makes a ram- 
pant growth. It is remarkably free from insect pests 
and fungous diseases. Prop, by softwood cuttings in-
