another bird in the cat-tails directly in front of us
began screaming like a hen in the clutches of
a hawk. Later we heard the long outcry three or
four times more but at wide intervals and always 
in the same place. The hen like screaming was
repeated at briefer intervals and the bird which
made it evidently moved its position sixty yards 
or more during our stay. It varied its cries considerably
and several times, after screaming, uttered the clucking
sound which Faxon and I have heard at Wayland
thus establishing its identify with the Wayland
mystery. Chapman identified some of its notes
without hesitation as those of the Florida Gallinule. 
He was utterly at a loss to pronounce on the
identify of the Cuckoo-like voice but we all thought
that at times it bore a resemblance to some of the notes
of the Gallinule. Perhaps it is the love song of the 
male of that species and the screaming cries are those of 
the [female]. We heard both cries at 7.45 when it was nearly dark. 
Soon after our arrival we heard the coo, coo-hoo-hoo
of a Least Bittern. This was repeated many times and 
finally the bird rose from the cat-tails and flew
about 100 yds like a Rail giving us a good view
of him. Just after sunset a Night Hawk appeared over
the swamp, flying high. In the twilight, later, a Wilson's
Snipe rose from the cat-tails and circled around us
going off towards Buch Island scaiping hoarsely. One
Night Heron came into the swamp at dusk and a solitary
Sandpiper [?peet-weeted] high in air overhead.
  After dark we walked along the Central track to
Alewife Brook and down the Fitchburg to [?Glaciatus]. The
meadows alive with Carolina rails all calling [?ir-e].
Hyla pickeringii a few. One Rana palustris. A few Bufo squawking
[?now] trilling. A few Rana [?].
