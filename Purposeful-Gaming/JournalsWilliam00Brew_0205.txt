1889
January 30
Charleston (S.C.) to Sanford, (Fla).
Clear and rather warm.
  Left Charleston at 4 a.m. joining Cory on
the train by appointment. We reached Savannah
about sunrise. South of Savannah saw palmetto
became abundant but it was of low growth,
not one 2 ft. high as a rule. South of Jacksonville
it became higher (4 to 8 ft). The tree palmetto became
numerous at Jacksonville; also water lily leaves ("bonnets")
very green and attractive to the eye,. Near Green Cove
Springs saw in bloom a few wild blackberries and
an elder which looked like ones having similar large
showy cymes of whitish flowers. In the swamps
the cypresses and larger deciduous trees were perfectly
bare but many of the sapling sweet gums were
scantily covered with young foliage, the leaves perhaps
1/3 grown. At Dinsmore, a place north of
Jacksonville we found Bartonia in bloom, a pretty
little flower very like Houstonia.
  During the day I saw about 50 Black Vultures
(not one C. aura), a pair of Killdeer (at Dinsmore) and
one Crow - absolutely nothing else.
  We reached Enterprise Junction at 6.40 and
I got off to wait for the baggage (which was
expected by the next train) and take it on
to Enterprise. After waiting three hours (during
which I had a long and very interesting talk
with a 'plume hunter' of the region) the train
came but neither baggage nor dogs did it
bring. Accordingly, I took it and went to
Sanford for the night, Cory having gone on
to the same place by the earlier train.
