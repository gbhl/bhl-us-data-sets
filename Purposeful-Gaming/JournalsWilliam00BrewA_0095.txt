1890
April, 21  
Seconnett Point, Rhode Island
Cloudless and warm. Wind W[est] to S[outh] W[est] blowing hard after
10 a.m.
  Got off at our usual time taking positions off
the High Rock where we shot yesterday afternoon.
I lay inside, Mackay next, and beyond him two
boats containing local gunners. It was evident
from the time we left the land that this was to 
be the flight of the season thus far for all the
conditions were favorable and the birds came 
thick and fast averaging, at times, at least
one flock every two or three minutes. The flocks
were much larger, too, than those we have hitherto
seen. At least seventy-five per cent were White-wings
the remaining twenty-five per cent equally divided
between Butter-bills and Surf Scoters. We also saw two 
flocks of Brant containing fifteen or twenty birds 
each.
  We changed guns just before starting and I
used M's 12 gauge during the entire morning. I
made very poor work with it getting only four 
birds out of twenty or more fairly good shots.
Of those four birds one was a fine ♂White-wing,
two Butter-bills, and the fourth a ♂ Skunk-head,
the latter a beautiful fellow with glossy black
plumage and richly painted bill.
  The fowl were very shy to-day and but few
came within really good range while still fewer
took any notice of the decoys. Indeed the largest
bag (seven birds) was made by a man lying
next the inner berth who had no stools. During
the first hour most of the birds passed outside
the outer boat. I accordingly changed my position
