1889
(Oct. 5)
above this the brook became very narrow and crooked 
with tangled alders arching completely over it in many
places. Finally we were stopped by a mass of drift wood.
I rapped the paddle sharply on the boat and at once
heard the unmistakable rush of Duck's wings. Taking up
the Fox gun and cocking it I waited. After nearly a
minute a single Black Duck appeared flying straight 
down the brook but at such a height that he looked
no larger than a Teal. Aiming about ten feet ahead of
him I fired more in wantonness than with any idea of
hitting him. To our amusement however he promptly
collapsed and came hurtling down with fearful velocity
striking in the brook within a few yards of the boat.
I have never seen a bird fatally hit at such a height
before. It must have been fully 300 feet. I shot the choke
barrel loaded with #4 shot/3 dra. (ounce). At the bridge on our
return we found a young White-crowned Sparrow hopping about
on some drift-wood in company with a Song Sparrow. I shot it.

  Nearly opposite Bottle Brook Pond we came on three Whistlers
swimming in the river. They rose and flew past us at long 
range. I dropped one with the first barrel (20 g.) but missed
with the second. A Downy Woodpecker drumming on the top of 
a tall dead pine. Two Canada Jays screaming & making a 
variety of odd sounds. Landed and eat lunch here.

  After lunch crept in to the lower cove of the pond. A fine
old [male] Grouse among the black alders on the point. Shot him.
Concealed myself behind a log on the shore & lay there about
two hours. A flock of six Wood Ducks passed  overhead but 
did not alight. Nothing came into the pond but a Heron &
a single Black Duck. A pair of Picoides arcticus passed near me.
Then Jim came & reported a Duck & a Phalarope in the next 
cove. The Duck proved a Whistler which I ambushed & shot. The
Phalarope I could not find. Back to camp by dark.
