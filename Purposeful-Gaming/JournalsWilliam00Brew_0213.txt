1889
Feb. 3
Enterprise, Florida
Clear and cool with N. wind.
  Did not hunt to-day but spent the
forenoon driving. C. taking a 22 cal. collecting
pistol with which he shot one and I
two Florida Jays in an old field grown
up to oak scrub. We saw fully eight of
them here. They were very tame, alighting
on fence posts & the tops of the oaks where
they sat erect and still. There were
also many Towhees (P. alleni) in this
field.
  In a hollow by the edge of a marshy pond
hole we saw a fine Garzetta with apparently
long plumes. It was within 30 yds. of a
barn from behind which C. shot at it
with a revolver but missed.
  In some burnt scrub we saw a single
adult [male] Geothlypis trichas
  Along the roadside saw many common
birds and one Dend. hypochrysea among
many true D. palmarum.
  On the way back visited a famous
Indian shell mound. Saw House Wrens
and Cardinals near it.
  Huckleberries (Var. nitidum) in full bloom everywhere
by the roadside; also yellow jasmine
  In some burnt woods (pines) Ceratiola ericoides a
curious yew-like shrub (allied to Empetrum nigrum)
formed a dense undergrowth two to six feet high.
I collected specimens of Andromeda ferruginea which
was common in moist places along the roadside.
