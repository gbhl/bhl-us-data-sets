[Falmouth, Massachusetts]
were numerous and in full song wherever there were thickets of
bayberry bushes among the sand-hills. From the fields and pastures
inland beyond the marshes came the distance voices of Grass Finches,
Meadow Larks and now & then the whistle of a Quail.
 Turning back we retraced our steps and drove to Falmouth
Heights and beyond. It was now dark or rather moonlight.
When we reached the pond where I found the Sharp-tails
yesterday a dense fog was rising. I could hear nothing
but frogs (R. catesbiana et clamitans) toads (Bufo fowleri?) and
tree toads (versicolor) the latter in the ponds.
  Reaching the house at 9 P.M. I put on my long boots
and went to the marsh behind the Howard's. We had passed
this marsh twice during our drive without hearing the
"Kicker" but I wanted to try him once more. I waited
on the edge for nearly ten minutes but if he is still there
he made no sign. There was a grand medley of toad
and frog voices with our Hyla versicolor singing steadily 
in the marsh. 
  This morning I saw a Song Sparrow fending two great
lubberly young Cow-birds which sat close together on the
top rail of a fence chirping exactly like young Sparrows.
  From our house I can hear Meadow Larks, Grass Finches,
Savanna Sparrows and Quail at all hours of the 
day but especially in early morning & at evening.
Robins are wonderfully abundant. I counted twenty
on our law this evening, all adult birds. Chimney
Swifts are numerous & I see them going in and
out a chimney on one of our neighbor's houses.
It is singular that Bobolinks are so scarce in these
great mowing fields. I have heard only one.
