Aug. 17
  A cool day with alternating showers and thunderstorms.
  After breakfast started down river to look
for the Prothonotary Warbler seen yesterday. Then

or heard and the chances of places in my 
particular quest seemed slender indeed.

  Nevertheless I kept on nearly to Ball's Hill.
Scrutinizing every thicket and landing at the

a Yellow Warbler and saw almost nothing else

saw my Warbler yesterday I noticed a Minosilla
in the swamp oak on the bark. Which investigation
a curious-looking bird appeared in the branches above
me. I shot it and found it to be a D. Striata in
most interesting condition, an adult in the [?]
of the change from [?] to autumnal plumage. 
  Letting the sail again I had reached and was passing
the ivy-covered rock opposite the lower end of the 
great Lusania bed where in the tree over this rock
I heard several birds chirping and at the same 
moment caught a glimpse of a Warbler which I 
fell sure, instantly, was my lost [?]. I
tore down the sail, paddled in under the drooping
maple branches and waited a moment in breathless 
suspense. The next a Warbler darted upward after
flying insect and instantly dropped again into them
