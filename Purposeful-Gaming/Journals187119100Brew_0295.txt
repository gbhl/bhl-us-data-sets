(May 23) 
A Canada Flycatcher singing in the swamp.
At least a dozen Black-polls in the pines on
the hill. No other emigrants.
  Returning to the boat I had pushed off and was
about to hoist the sail when my eye caught a 
flock of birds coming up river flying swiftly close
to the water. They passed within 50 yds and I 
positively made them out to Yellow-legs, eight
T. melonolenca, the ninth as certainly T. flavipes,
the latter not half the size of the rest. They
whistled as they turned the bend of the ruin
above but kept on out of sight.
  Landed next at Lee Davis' hill & took a
long tramp. Wind fairly roaring through the
trees drowning all other sounds. Wood apparently
lifeless, saw almost no birds & heard only a very
few.
  Lunched in the canoe at the lower landing
then went ashore and ransacked the big pine
woods and the country beyond. Few birds
seen or heard. A pair of Turtle Doves in an oak
the male cooing at intervals & oscillating the head
& neck in the usual way.  Saw no less than
seven of these Doves to-day, three pairs & a single one.
  Returning up the river late in the afternoon
shot a solitary Least Sandpiper on the flat
where I killed six the last trip.  It was doubtless
a survivor of that flock.
  Heard two Parulas in the big pines. Found
two Redwings' nests with 4 eggs each & saw birds
start from others that I did not examine.
Birds of all kinds in full song now.
Swarms of dragonflies of several species in the woods to-day.
