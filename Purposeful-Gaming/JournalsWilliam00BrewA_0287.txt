Lake Umbagog, Maine.
we got within range. There were two others in sight
at the same time.
  Black Ducks are very scarce and I fear most 
of them have left us. We saw only two to-day.

  There are a few Robins lingering still and I 
saw a Marsh Hawk at Moose Point. The Lake 
is very high and the meadows entirely submerged.

Lake Umbagog, Maine.
  A dense fog in the morning shrowding the Lake
until past ten o'clock. After that dead calm 
and hot sun for an hour, then fast gathering
clouds and strong S.E. wind all the afternoon.
  Spent the day about camp taking a sail
in my canoe in the afternoon.
