When I saw the plots he had treated in this Way, 
they were green and had a fair amount of fruit, whereas 
the surrounding bog, and even plots he had sprayed with 
arsenate of lead, had been turned brown by the insect and 
bore practically no crop. 
We tried this treatment against the first brood on 
two large plots this season, and while it failed to control 
the insect entirely, it checked it so much that the plots 
remained green while the surrounding bog was turned 
rather brown, the contrast being striking. 
We must test this insecticide further before we can 
say at what strength, cost and effectiveness both con- 
sidered, it should be used, or how many times it should 
be applied to either brood. At the strength in which it 
has so far been tested, it seems a rather expensive treat- 
ment, for it would probably cost about $7.00 per acre per 
application. Future experiments may show, however, 
that weaker mixtures are sufficient. At any rate, this 
treatment stands at present as the only really effective 
method of controlling the first brood of the insect, burning 
and flooding excepted, and in spite of its expense, it will, 
for this reason, find favor in the management of many 
bogs. I think that two applications for the first brood will 
probably be found advisable. I suspect that as a treatment 
for the second brood it may have to compete with arsenate 
of lead, for there is a large chance of injuring tender foli- 
age, and especially blossoms, in spraying with any contact 
insecticide and arsenate of lead is far more effective a- 
gainst the second brood than against the first. I rather 
anticipate that two treatments of the first brood with 
"Black Leaf 40" will be found so effective in checking 
the pest that a thorough treatment for the second brood 
will not seem so necessary as it is at present. In any 
case, not more than one treatment of the second brood 
with "Black Leaf 40" is likely to be desirable. 
Just how "Black Leaf 40" controls this insect is a 
question. Black-head worms sprayed under observation 
did not seem much affected by it and in fair weather the
