actually got nearly to the railroad bridge when loud
and distinct came the singular song we had been
listening for from the very spot, as nearly as we
could tell, where Faxon heard it on the 19th. The
bird sang five or six times in succession, then
some canoes filled with people talking came along
and it stopped. We had no time to wait longer
so left it for to-night & took the 9.21 train home.
  As before stated we saw only a very few Swallows
below the Manse but above they were numerous
most of them White-bellies with broods of young
on wing or sitting on telegraph wires. We repeatedly 
saw the old birds feed the young on wing. There
were also a few Eave Swallows and a good
number of Bank Swallows. Probably we saw
40 to 50 Swallows in all. There were two pairs
of Martens at the houses just below Mr. Sanborn's.
These I think are the only birds feeding in Concord
this year.
  At least three different Savanna Sparrows were
singing, one at Red Bridge, two near the Fitchburg
bridge. Two Whippoorwills singing on the hill S.
of Dugan Brook meadow. A Wood Duck flying
over the maple swamp near the French's landing.
A Night Heron quaking but not seen, in the same
locality. Wilson's Thrush singing in this swamp.
A Yellow-wing & Savanna Sparrow singing near
together at the old sand bank. Several Bobolinks
singing in the meadow near this bank. Red-wings
singing infrequently. A Cat-bird in full song.
No Rails heard above the town.
