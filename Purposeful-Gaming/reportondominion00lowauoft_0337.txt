GEOLOGY 225 
Dr. Armstrong, of the Investigator, referring to the northern 
part of Banks island, states that outliers of Carboniferous lime- 
stone are found at Cape Crozier and near Mercy bay, along 
with the sandstones and shales with coaly streaks. 
It is doubtful if the Carboniferous rocks occur on the north- 
west part of North Devon, though placed there by De rance 
and Dawson. Schei found only Silurian and Devonian on the 
northern part of that island explored by him, and the Carbon- 
iferous rocks do not show on the west coast of Ellesmere until 
Store Bjornekap is reached. If a line were carried from the 
outcrops of these rocks on Bathurst island northward to Store 
Bjornekap it would cross the western part of Grinnell (island) 
peninsula, but there is no reason to suppose that the outcrop 
would follow such a line. 
The Carboniferous rocks of western Ellesmere appear to be 
isolated areas resting upon the underlying Devonian, and in 
turn covered by Mesozoic rocks. Schei describes the area at 
Store Bjornekap as consisting in its lowest part of beds of 
brownish-gray, hard, fossiliferous limestone; higher up, of a 
white pure limestone, flinty limestone and pure "flint strata, 
richly fossiliferous, among the fossils being Lithostrotion sp., 
Fenestella sp., Streptorhynchus crenistria, rhynchonella (Pug- 
nax) sp., Spirifer cfr. ovalis, cuspidatus, mosquensis, Produc- 
tus cfr. semireticulatus, costatus, punctatus, cora, &c. 
the extreme northeast part of Axel Heiberg island is marked 
as Carboniferous by Schei, but there are no notes concerning 
this locality in his geolocigal summary. 
The Carboniferous sandstones have not been found in the 
northeast part of Ellesmere island, but limestones of that age 
were found in several localities to the west of Dana bay, and 
there is every likelihood that rocks of this age extend across the 
northern part of the island to join those of the western shore 
and the northern part of Axel Heiberg island.
