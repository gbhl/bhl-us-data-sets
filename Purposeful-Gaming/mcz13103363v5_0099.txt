Wednesday, July 7, 1869.
  Clear & Warm. Ther.
about 70[degrees] - 80[degrees] - 70[degrees]. Rose
a little early.  After breakfast
H. Gardner came out according
to agreement & we started
off after the Woodcock, taking
Dart. Tied first in Waltham
and beat a number of runs
getting up quantities of birds
but bagging only four, &
firing perhaps as many
more shots. Dart behaved
splendidly, retrieving all
the birds & making one ex-
ceedingly staunch point.
Then on to another tying
place where we eat our dinner
& got out another bird but
missed him. Then tied again
& flushed about half a dozen
birds I killing one at a snap shot.
Got home by sunset.
Philopila Minor, birds scattered
& no difference in size between
the young & the old.
Thursday, July 8, 1869.
  Clear & pleasant. Ther.
about 60[degrees] - 78[degrees] - 70[degrees].
Rose as usual but did
not feel very well.
Took a long ride with
father in A.M. In
P.M. slept most of the
time. In the eveninjg
felt very sick & was
threatened with a fever
but came out of it
about midnight after
repeated bathings of
my head and arms in
rum & water, and hot
applications to my feet.
