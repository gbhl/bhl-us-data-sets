where I shot a pair in 1876. There was also
an Ardea cyretta near & a Centunus in these
palmettos, both of which birds I remember
there in 1876. The Welkiva also seemed to have
changed not at all since my last visit.
We went up about a mile to-day & in
this distance saw six Ardea caerulea; two
Anhingas, and a female Wood Duck. The sweet
gums, ash trees (Fraxinus americanus?), maple (Acer ruber) and
cornels were  in nearly full leaf & the cypresses
fast coming in foliage. The Willows (Salix niger) were
covered with small leaves & were in full bloom
& alive with bees. The river was very beautiful
and its setting intensely green wherever the eye
rested. Cardinals and Grackles (Quiscalis aglaeus) were
numerous everywhere, the former in song. In
the cypress swamp a Pileated Woodpecker was
calling & several B. l. alleni screaming incessantly
as they soared against the sky. We met a
native who had come down eight miles. He saw
many Herons & about about twelve Cornlans on the way.
Have not seen a Parrakeet for two years nor an Ivory
billed Woodpecker within a year. Snail Hawks still
visit the Welkiva prairie. He saw one there last Dec.
Cornlans are not decreasing much; they are little molested.
  On the way back to Lake Monroe I shot a
Bittern which we saw alight & afterwards flushed.
It proved a [female]. Also shot four Red-wings. A Barred
Owl hooting in a hamack. The Cuckoo-like call
swelling up all over the flooded meadows. Found
Coots wherever we heard it but also saw one or two
Grebes. Saw only four Ducks & perhaps twenty Coots
during the day. D. dominica, & Parula in full song. Found
an Eagles nest, Bird screaming about it.
