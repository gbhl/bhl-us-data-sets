GENERAL PAPERS 57 
as we have worked them out on a series of 250 carefully 
studied cases. The line C.C. shows requests for these exami- 
nations in a series of 8,000 cases as they were entered in our 
institution during 1913 and 1914. The line B.B. shows the 
increased demand for this work as illustrated by data from 
4,500 cases entered during 1915. Whereas in our laboratory 
in 1915, 6,349 examinations were made, 40,000 examinations 
would have been made had the cases entered been studied as 
carefully as indicated in the selected 250 cases. 
As to the financial returns for this work, suffice it to say 
that our records show that this work can be carried on and be 
made self-supporting. 
In the larger institutions at the present time there is room 
for two or three men who can profitably devote their entire 
time to this class of scientific work. In smaller institutions at 
least one person can find a field of work in the hospital. In 
our smaller towns where a hospital is not available our teach- 
ers of physics, chemistry and physiology can find a field both 
profitable and educational by associationg themselves with one 
or more of the practitioners in their community. If any of 
you should doubt these statements, in proof of the demand 
for this class of workers I have only to refer you to the 
"Want Column" of the medical publications. 
In conclusion, I would like to thank Dr. Albert R. Trapp, 
who has been associated with me in the study of the 250 spe- 
cial cases mentioned, and in the work of making the classifi- 
cations and outlines presented.
