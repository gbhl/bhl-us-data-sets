times in the big meadow about 150 yds. off. The next moment
the bird started out of the grass and after flying about
30 yds. alighted again.
  After leaving the Central we crossed to Bach Island and
listened awhile to the Long-billed Marsh Wrens of which
two or three males were constantly singing. In a little piece
of wild meadow, covered with short wiry grass, at the
north end of the "Island" we started a Savannah Sparrow
which evidently had either eggs or young but we
could not find either. The bird followed us about, chirping.
  Saw one Green Heron flying across the tracks from
Pout Pond to Bach Island swamp.
  Two Bobolinks singing, one in a meadow north of
Bach Island, the other beyond Hill's Crossing in the
Belmont meadows.
  Took the 1 p.m. train for Porter's & thence home.
