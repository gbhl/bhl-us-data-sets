way stated that the scoop exhibited was used last year in 
picking over 500 barrels. A lot of interest was shown 
in the scoop, which appeared to work very well. 
After this exhibition, the meeting was called to- 
gether again and the treasurer gave his report, which 
was accepted as read. 
Then Professor Franklin gave his annual talk upon 
the things discovered at the experimental bog during the 
year, a full report of which will probably be printed 
later. 
The price to be paid for picking was discussed and it 
was voted as the sense of the meeting that the price for 
scooping should not exceed 75c per hour. An attempt to 
fix the price to be paid per box failed. 
The selling price of cranberries was also discussed 
and the general opinion was that early blacks should not 
bring less than $10 a barrel. President Hennessy said 
that he thought it was within the province of the associa- 
tion to fix the price for which their product should be 
sold, and he hoped that the members would think the 
matter over and next year come prepared to take some 
action upon the matter. 
The meeting was a very successful one from all 
points of View. The gathering was a representative one 
of the cranberry growers and there were a number of 
ladies present. 
The meeting adjourned at about four o'clock.
