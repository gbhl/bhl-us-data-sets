1988                                                  
Sept 1.
Lake Umbagog, Maine
Cloudy with frequent showers: rained hard all last night
  Reached "lakeside" last evening at seven o'clock.              
On the way home Bethel saw no birds of any                       
particular interest. The roadsides were bands of                   
blue, purple, white and yellow from the golden rods         
and asters which were in unusual profusion.
I saw also Eupatorium, a few ??, and a white
flower (in the Notch) new to me. It grew in
clusters at the head of tall stalks and was very
showy &[and] beautiful; In the Notch saw a single
maple wholly crimson but for the most of
the way the woods were wholly green.

  Last night was still, dark & misty. Thrushes             
were flying in extrordinary numbers all the    
evening. I heard them for nearly two hours                     
as I lay in bed and their calls at times
were almost incessant. I suppose most of 
them were T.Swainsoni (I now feel sure they were Veeres 1907)

  At day break this morning I heard Golden
Plover whistling. There were evidently flying
about and they must have passed near
the house several times.

  Spent the day about the house repairing
my canoe etc. Saw many birds from the
piazza, an eagle & an Osprey fishing off the
landing, a pair of very large Ducks with                               
apparently creamy white crowns & backs flying             
about the river's mouth & finally alighting
well out from shore & swimming about for some
time. They looked very like [male] Eiders.
