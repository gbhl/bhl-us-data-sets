MEMORIAL NOTICE 
The contributions made by Gilbert Whitley to the publications of the 
Society are unlikely to be equalled. His first paper in The Australian Zoologist 
(on parasitism in lower animals) appeared in 1925 in Volume 3, Part 8, and 
almost every issue since then (including the present one) contains one or more 
of his articles. The name of G. P. Whitley first appears in The Proceedings of the 
Royal Zoological Society of N.S.W. in 1936 and again he was a regular contributor 
to subsequent volumes. Many of his original scientific papers deal with fishes, 
but the remainder cover a wide variety of animal groups, as one would expect 
from a naturalist with such broad zoological interests. Other articles, such as 
book reviews, biographies and historical notes also appeared frequently. 
In 1947 Gilbert Whitley became editor of both The Zoologist and The 
Proceedings. He edited all issues of The Zoologist from Volume 11, Part 2, to 
Volume 16, Part 1 (except for 13(2)) and all volumes of The Proceedings until 
1970. In all these issues, a painstaking attention to detail and an editorial 
precision of professional standard is clearly evident. His editorial as well as his 
literary talents are also seen in the Handbooks he produced on scientific and 
historical subjects. 
The Society has lost one of its most distinguished supporters whose level 
of scholarship and productivity were quite exceptional. Many members have felt 
the loss of a colleague and a friend.
