156 CRUISE OF THE NEPTUNE 
obtained for the purpose from oxide of iron found in the 
interior. 
As soon as the frame is complete, all the women of the en- 
campment join in sewing on the sealskin cover, as the operation 
when started must be completed at one sitting, before the skins 
dry. The seams are made with a double lap, and are quite 
water-tight. The skin shrinks on drying, and becomes stretched 
like a drum over the frame. 
The natives have another boat called the umiak or Woman's 
boat. This is also made with a wooden frame covered with 
skins, but it is much larger than the hunting kyak of the men. 
In shape it roughly resembles a large square-ended punt, being 
often twenty feet and over in length, by six feet or more across 
the middle section, and tapering towards the ends to about half 
that width. It is made quite deep, and is capable of carrying a 
very heavy load. Usually two or more families use a single 
umiak to transport their goods from place to place, and as the 
poles and Big sealskin covering of each tent weigh upwards of 
half a ton, the capacity of these boats can be realized. 
The framework is heavy, and the sides are kept in place by 
a number of cross thwarts, which also serve as seats for the 
rowers. The covering is made from the large skins of the Big 
seal (Phoca barbata), sewn together in a manner similar to the 
covering of the kyak. This craft is rowed by the women, 
usually with an old man as steersman. It is propelled by rude 
oars made from small trees, the handle being formed from the 
thick part, while the blades are made by attaching strips on two 
sides of the smaller end. Two or more women pull each oar, 
which vary in number from two to four. 
The only place where such boats are known by the writer to 
be used is along the south side of Hudson strait and about 
Ungava bay. Elsewhere the whaleboat has been found more 
convenient, and when the planking is worn out they are covered 
with
