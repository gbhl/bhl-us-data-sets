Saturday, December 24.
  Clear and a lovely day for
the season and very warm.
Ther. about 24 [degrees]���40 [degrees]���
30 [degrees]. Rose as usual and
fed the setter before breakfast.
After breakfast had to wait
some time for Ruth. Then
we started in a sleigh with
the General & Bill dropped us in
the middle of the Bittern swamp.
Saw a rf grouse. Then met a man
fox hunting; then fired at a rabbit;
then saw a young bald eagle; then eat
lunch; then Ruth fired at a snow bunt;
then tried to head off the fox hounds;
then down Concord avenue; then
across 'the pond' where they were
marking; heard a tit lark; then
home. Everywhere we went in
Lexington we saw plenty of fox
tracks, indeed there was scarcely
a field that they had not crossed.
Saw a blue jay.
