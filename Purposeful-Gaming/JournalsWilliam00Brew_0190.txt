1888
(Nov. 13)
  After this we started four more Grouse but
I had only one good shot which I missed
with both barrels. The bird started within ten
yards among some scrub oaks and made so
much noise that it startled me and I
fired wildly.
  All the Grouse seen to-day took only long
flights and were hard to follow and find
a second time.
  The country we traversed was almost
destitute of small birds. We saw a few Jays,
Chickadees and Tree Sparrows, one Creeper, a Hairy
Woodpecker and two or three Crows but no
Robins, Juncos, Fox Sparrows or Kinglets.
