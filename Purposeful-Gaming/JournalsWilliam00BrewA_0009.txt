1890
January 14
Clear and still. Frosty in early morning, warm at noon, the
roads muddy. The grass in many places, especially on springy 
slopes with a southern exposure, literally as green as in early 
May. Cows grazing in the fields, cocks crowing lustily.

  Met Faxon at the Punch Bowl Swamp by appointment     
at 10 a.m. We hoped to find Marsh Wrens and Swamp Sparrows [
but in this we were disappointed for we skirted the entire
swamp without one of either species. Song Sparrows, however,
were more numerous than I have ever before seen them in 
winter in this neighborhood. We must have started
more than a dozen and others were heard chirping. All
were in the cat-tails and long grass there being no
bushes in this swamp. With them were a very few 
Tree Sparrows and very many English Sparrows. All three
species seemed to be feeding on the seeds of the cat-tails.
At least we saw them in the act of picking the heads 
to pieces, scattering the thistle-like down to the wind.

  We came upon at least two cats in this swamp & 
the birds must suffer severely from their attentions. One
served us a good turn, however, by starting up what we
both agreed must have been a Spizella socialis. It alighted
on a tall reed and for several minutes chipped at the cat
excitedly and continuously. We had a good view of its 
breast, Back and wings through F's glass at about 30 yds. 
Finally it flew across the swamp & pitched down into
the cat-tails again. I left Faxon pursuing it.

  On the eastern side of this swamp we saw a flock
of five Red Crossbills. They kept flying down to the ground
and back into some oaks & cedars. One of the cedars was
also literally alive with Cedar birds. After feeding on the 
berries for a while they collected in a dense cluster
