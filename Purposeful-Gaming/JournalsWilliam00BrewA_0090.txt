out alighted against the mast of a sail boat. 
The mast had been just greased and the 
poor bird slid down it at least six inches
backwards, then gave it up and flew to
the mast of another boat where he received
a firm foothold and clung until we
were out of sight. 
  We spent an interesting forenoon on the
sheltered side of High Rock on the south side
of the island. Saw a few Gulls & an occasional
Cormorant passing. A fine adult Loon
suddenly came to the surface below us about 
100 yds. off with a flounder fully [?6?8] inches long 
by 5 in. [inches] wide. He spent five or six minutes
working at his [?prize] in order, apparently, to get
him in proper condition to swallow. He would
pinch him vigorously in his bill then drop him
and strike him a number of sharp blows in
quick succession. [?Twice] the fish sank & he had
to dive for him. Finally he stretched his neck
up pointing his bill straight upward & with
one or two vigorous gulps swallowed the fish. 
A Horned Grebe in fine plumage came directly
under us diving repeatedly. We could see  him 
for ten feet or more under water. He looked
like a fish but I could see his wings flap. 
The water was green & probably 12 ft [feet] deep. The 
bird went down at about this angle [diagram].
  A Brown Creeper [?spend] the day on the island 
alighting on weed stalks running up the face of big
boulders [?] into crannies in the rock but
feeding most of the time on the [?lawn] & on the
side of an earthy bank. He hopped about exactly like a Sparrow.
