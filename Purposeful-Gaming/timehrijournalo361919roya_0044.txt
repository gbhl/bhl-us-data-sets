compared with those of the candle-makers of Paris who endeavoured to 
restrict by legislation the construction of windows in order to bring 
about a betterment of the candle industry. The cry " Guiana for the 
Guianese " lacks sympathy with the spirit of these times when it is more 
than ever before the duty of each unit of the Empire, however humble, 
to sink its ewn particular ends to those of Empire. Similarly in these 
days when the world is emerging from the titanic struggle in which 
civilisation itself has been at stake, any sentiment for the maintenance 
of the few remaining vestiges of artificial barriers to the onward sweep 
of civilisation in the development of world resources for the benefit of 
the civilised race, in the nature of hindrance of legitimate international 
investment, is totally at variance from the spirit of brotherhood of 
civil sed nations that obtains to-day, and is a relic of the doctrine of 
every nation for itself and the devil take the hindmost, and its in- 
evitable accompaniment of petty international strife, intrigue and jealousy. 
Such doctrine is directly responsible for the appalling events of the past 
four years, and only by the discarding of such a doctrine by the civilised 
nations has civilisation as we know it to-day been saved from perishing 
from the very face of the earth. 
The future undoubtedly holds in store enormous demands that the 
Colony's resources could supply, and it behoves the people of British 
Guiana, the custodians of this important storehouse of the Empire's 
resources, to be prepared to make the best of opportunities for rapid 
advancement in the near future. 
While the railway project has of necessity been temporarily shelved 
due to the impossibility of obtaining the necessary machinery and equip- 
ment, there would seem to be no reason why the building of well-con- 
structed highways should not be undertaken at once, especially when, as 
appears later, more than one hundred miles of existing roads leading to 
the hinterland, representing a large investment by the colony (most 
of which lies idle) are available for inclusion in a scheme for reaching 
the interior by road. 
Mention of the scientific encouragement of settlement on the vast 
areas tapped and served by the great Canadian and American transcon- 
tinental railroads may not be inopportune in view of the great interest 
that has been aroused and the serious efforts that are about to be made, 
in the matter of colonisation. It is fairly well known that capital was 
induced to embark upon the construction of the earlier transcontinental 
lines in North America, because of the liberal attitude of the Canadian 
and American Governments with respect to the granting of land to the 
Railroad Companies. Most of the first settlers naturally located in fairly 
close proximity to the main transcontinental line. These lands, controlled 
by the Railroad Companies, however, were naturally more valuable and 
therefore more difficult of acquisition by the immigrant of small means 
than the lands more remote, or what are known by the local term of 
" second depths " or " back lands." While the railroad companies
