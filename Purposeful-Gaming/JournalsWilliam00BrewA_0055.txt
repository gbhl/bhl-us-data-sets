1890
March 21
Suwanee River, Florida
Clear and warm.
  Spent most of the day at the Bluffs
casting off our mooring late in the afternoon
and drifting down stream two or three miles.
  Had a rather early breakfast after which
Chapman and I started for the Heronry. The
way led through [?sparse] [?pine] woods where
Bluebirds, [?Pine] Warblers, and Flickers were singing
and Palm Warblers flitting from shrub to
shrub alighting frequently on the ground. 
  Reaching the Heronry we found a series of
small shallow ponds bordered by small stunted
cypresses with a few of these trees also scattered
singly or in groups well out in the ponds.
These isolated trees all had nests large structures
of sticks some in their tops other on their 
lateral branches. Each nest had several
young Herons most of them full grown &
well feathered. They were standing erect in the
nests or out on the neighboring branches as
we approached but as soon as they discovered
us they all took to the nests and squatted
down in them. Chapman killed two with
his auxiliary (first [?throwing] one of them down from
the nest). 
  He started several Snipe about this [?] &
I heard a Robin calling. On the way back
through the pine woods heard two Bachman's
Finches singing [?divinely]. I shot one of them.
After getting back to the boat I crossed the
river in my canoe to the place where I
shot yesterday. There were many Warblers
