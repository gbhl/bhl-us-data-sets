1889
June 15
E. Lexington, Mass.
Clear with a heavy thunder shower in P.M. Evening clear
and cool with strong S.W. wind.
  To E. Lexington with Faxon by 6.25 train. Our object
was to ascertain what birds are found about the
reservoir and its bordering marshes. Faxon heard (on
the th) there the kik-kik-kik cry, the ka-e of the
Carolina Rail (only one bird), a short squawk which
he did not recognize, but which came from the
marsh, and a Whippoorwill.
  This evening the weather was unfavorable for it
was both too cool and too windy for birds to sing
well. As we crossed a hilly pasture we heard a
Grass Finch & several Song Sparrows and started a
Flicker from its nest in an old apple tree. About
the pond Swamp Sparrows were singing numerously
during Faxon's last visit but we heard only
one to-night. I thought I caught kik-kik-kik
cry once or twice in the distance but am
not sure. We heard no Rails. Bull frogs in full
blast & many green frogs. Two Night Herons came
over the pond from the west, about dusk, quaking
loudly. The trip was a dismal failure on the
whole. I reached home about 10 p.m.
