Oct. 16
Great Island, Hyannis, Mass.
Clear and warmer, wind S.W.
  It fell to my lot this morning to enter the park
in pursuit of a deer, Cory and Chamberlain having failed
to get one yesterday. Starting at about 8.30 I was soon
within the woods stealing cautiously along the silent paths
scanning the scrub intently as I went. Passing the pigeon
houses I took the path to the "elk pen" which I reached
without having seen a living thing. Turning to the right
I next took the path to the great clearing. In the scrub
on the left I twice started a large doe which went
dashing off in fine style. Entering the clearing I was
creeping through the pines when I spied a small Hawk
coming in from the sea. On set wings he scaled across
the opening only a few yards above the ground passing
me within good gun-shot and showing the clear-cut shape
and unmistakable color & marking of a fine adult
[male] Duck Hawk. Having only a rifle I could do nothing
but gaze longingly at him as he passed.
  Returning to the pigeon houses I found there a young
buck which worked quickly off into the scrub without
giving me a shot but which did not detect my presence.
I then visited the open oak woods at the west end
of the park seeing a firm large doe which stood perfectly
motionless for a moment staring at me and then
took to flight starting two others as she ran.
  It was nearly noon when I again returned to the
pigeon houses. As a last chance I concealed myself
in the scrub on the leeward side of the hollow in hopes
that the buck seen there earlier in the day might
visit the spot. After waiting about fifteen minutes
I caught sight of a deer stealing down over the
opposite ridge through the trees. Presently he came out
