234 CRUISE OF THE NEPTUNE 
bay. At Erik harbour, on the south side of the mouth of Ponds 
inlet, there is evidence that the glacier which now terminates 
at the head of the harbour once extended five miles farther sea- 
ward, and filled the valley to a height of 400 feet above the 
present level of the sea. Above that height the rocky walls of 
the harbour are not glaciated, and are covered by slopes of dis- 
integrated rock. Passing north of Lancaster sound to the south 
of North Devon, there is little evidence to show that the glacia- 
tion was ever much more severe than at present. At Cuming 
creek, a narrow fiord cut some twelve miles into the limestone 
cliffs, there is evidence that a glacier once covered its bottom, 
and rose some two or three hundred feet above the present level 
of the sea; but it was purely local, and the limestone cliffs 
-everywhere show that they have been long subjected to subaerial 
denudation, and that the broken rock covering their sides has 
never been displaced by ice. 
Very little time was given to the study of glaciation at Cape 
sabine, and the only evidence to show that it was more intense 
formerly was a low moraine in rear of Peary's house at Payer 
harbour. Schei, who devoted considerable attention to the gla- 
ciation of Ellesmere, is of the opinion that the ice covering 
never greatly exceeded its present limits, if it did so at all. 
MARINE TERRACES. 
Marine terraces are found along the coasts of the northern 
mainland and islands wherever the conditions are suitable. 
Fronting the highlands about Wager inlet and Repulse bay, on 
the western side of Hudson bay, terraces are found cut into the 
-drift deposits up to elevations varying from 500 to 700 feet. 
The highest terrace seen by Dr. Bell on the north side of Hud- 
son strait had an elevation of 528 feet above the present sea- 
level. At Cape Wolstenholme, on the south side of the western 
entrance to Hudson strait the terraces rise to 800 feet above the
