  Down river in my canoe at 10 A.M.

  Just below Hunt's Pond I had a fair cross shot at a 
King fisher but missed. At Dakin's Hill I started another 
from the maples over hanging the river and killed it
as it was flying off down stream.  At the report there 
was a good amount of Carolina Rails in the reeds below
and I  next turned my attention to them but although
I pushed the canoe back and forth through their retreat
I rounded only three two of which I shot, our flying,
the other as it was skipping across are opening.
  In the birch swamp opposite this point I stumbled on 
a Woodcock which flitted only a few yards and alighting
ran for upwards of fifty yds until lost to sight behind 
some brush. The ground was perfectly smooth and free from 
weeds or other cover and I had a good view of the bird.
It ran steadily very much in the manner of, and at
about the same speed as, as Piping or Wilson's Plovea, and
not at all like a gallinaceous bird.  I afterwards flushed
it again but this time it rose vigorously and flew a
long distance, whistling shrilly.  The only other bird seen
here was a solitary Overn-bird.
  I hunched under the oak at Ball's Hill landing
and afterwards sailed down river to Carlisle bridge
and most of the way back to town.  On every return
saw two Greebes, the first of then Autumn, both
apparently young birds, and both very shy.
  I saw only four Swallows (all Barn), two Hawks
(B. borealis), and no Ducks, Herons, or Blackbirds.
Bobolinks were heard chinking several times but
always in the distance. No Warblers along the Banks and
