Oct. 27
Cloudy with light rain at intervals. Clearing at sunset.
  Spent the day in camp skinning birds. There were two
small flocks of "Sea Ducks" in the Lake flying up &
down close to the water occasionally alighting near
the middle opposite our camp. Our flock contained
nine birds which seemed to be wholly black except the
top of the head which looked white or whiteish. They may
have been Old Squaws but they appeared to be much larger.

  Broke camp to-day and went to Lakeside by steamer
late in the afternoon. Caught two Canada Jays in
a box and took them down with me. Saw no Ducks.

Early morning cloudy with fine driving rain. Rest
of day clearing the sun peeping out at intervals.
  Left Lakeside for Bethel at 8 A. M. Just as the
stage was about to start immense numbers of
Scoters suddenly appeared flying high at first
finally sweeping down after many revolutions & alighting
in five separate flocks. The largest of which contained
fully 500 birds. Three boats put out in pursuit
of them but they rose wild & began wheeling &
circling again. There were six Robins in the field
in front of the house.

started from the roadside below Brooks' & two Grouse in
the road below the Notch. Also three Crows in Newry.
