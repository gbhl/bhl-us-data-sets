1889
Clear and cool. Wind blowing a gale all day from the N.
  Started at about 8 a.m. taking the Captain and
Anderson in the big boat. Cory did not go out at all.
  I went directly to the place where we shot yesterday.
Just after leaving the vessel I killed a Lesser Scaup
which came past me down wind going like a bullet.
Did not fire again until reaching my stand. We
saw thousands of Coots and a fair number of Scaups
on the way. At the island about 300 Pintails
were feeding some forty yards off shore. They presented
a fine appearance as there were many old drakes
among them. They kept up a low conversational
chattering and quacking. I tried to stalk them
but failed and they all went off down the bay.
Putting out the decoys I made a stand and
lay in it for about two hours. The first bird
that came was a fine old male Pintail which
dropped to my second barrel. A few other Ducks
passed out of range but as there was evidently no
prospect of good shooting I called the men, took
up the decoys and rowed back to the gut.
Here we made another stand. Several Scaups came
in to the decoys as soon as we put them out
and I killed one. After getting fairly settled,
however, I spent the entire afternoon without
getting a single fair shot at a Duck. Many
Scaups flew past out of range & an occasional
bunch of Pintails hurtled overhead high in air.
Once when I had left the stand for a
moment, a pair of Florida Black Ducks came
