a nest under an overhanging gravel bank, a
Song Sparrow sitting on a nest which was
placed in a grassy bank directly over the brook,
a Black-poll Warbler singing in the oaks, and
in the distance Tanagers, Grosbeaks and two 
Wood Thrushes.
   From here we took the cross road to the
Turnpike reaching which we turned westward
again and drove through the larch swamp. 
At the east end saw a Buteo borealis and a 
pair of B. lineatus. The latter circling high in air
screaming. At the west end heard and finally
saw a Golden-winged Warbler which was among 
oak scrub on a hillside. Chapman tried to
shoot him but failed. 
  Came home by way of the Turnpike and
Prospect St. stopping in the latter to visit the deep 
glen and again at the cold spring by the [?lane].
  During the day we saw a great number of
common summer birds but actually only three
which were certainly migrants these being two
Canadian and one Black-poll Warbler. Such
a paucity of northern-bound species on a warm
day at this date is certainly surprising. 
  Vegetation is not advancing rapidly and
none of the trees in the woods are in full
leaf. Wild geraniums, columbines, blueberry bushes, 
choke-cherry and Pyrus arbutifolia in bloom. 
Barberry blossoms nearly out.
  Bobolinks seem to be unusually numerous this
season. We must have seen or heard at least
thirty different males today.
  Reached home at 6.30 P.M.
