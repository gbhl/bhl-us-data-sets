Oct. 5
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Clear and colder with high N.W. wind the Lake white-
capped at times. 
  Left Lakeside with M. by steamer at 9 A.M. and 
reached camp an hour later. On the way saw two Loons, 
a Black Duck, and Velvet Scoter, the latter in the 
Lake in front of the Hayward Plan.

  After dinner M. and I rowed over to the Outlet and
down the Androscoggin to the second bend. Landing
on the left bank we beat the meadows for Snipe 
starting six of which I bagged three (in three shots)
and M. two. Saw a high Pectoral Sandpiper scaling 
about in the usual erratic way.

  We then rowed back to near the Outlet and took
stations in the grass on the east bank near a 
pool where feathers and other signs showed that Black
Ducks had been feeding lately. We waited here
until it was nearly dark but no Ducks came in. 
As we were about to get into the boat and push
off I heard a Snipe coming uttering its hoarse scaipe
at frequent intervals. Just as it was passing I saw
it for an instant against the light in the west
and firing a snap [?] dropped it dead into the
middle of the river.

  Just after sunset there was a subdued but general
chorus of Leopard Frogs' croaking rolling over the marshes. 
I have heard them here before in October but
never on such a cold windy evening as this.
