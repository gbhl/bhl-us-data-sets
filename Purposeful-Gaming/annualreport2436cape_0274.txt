Berries run through a Hayden separator were com- 
pared in storage tests with fruit cleaned with the White 
machine and the results showed, as those of like tests did 
the year before, that the two kinds of machines cause 
about the same amount of injury. 
FROST STUDIES 
As the records made at the Station during the past 
five years seemed a fair basis for a study of frost con- 
ditions on cranberry bogs on Cape Cod, and as the great 
loss from frost last September made the need of closer 
predictions seem imperative, I gave most of last winter 
to a careful investigation in this connection. My most 
important result was a new method for computing mini- 
mum temperatures on any night in which frost condi- 
tions prevail. This method can probably be refined much 
more, but it is already in fair condition for practical use 
in forecasting. It probably is as reliable for computing 
on windy nights, if they are clear, as on still ones, but 
much cloudiness during the night renders it inaccurate. 
Predictions by the new method are made from read- 
ings at 8 P. M., standard time (9 P. M. as the clocks now 
run) . As a few minutes are needed to take the readings 
and make the calculation, I do not have the forecast ready 
until 8:15. I want the prediction made at that time to 
be regarded as the standard forecast for the night. An 
opinion based on less accurate reckoning, however, will 
be given at any time from 6 to 8 P. M. 
As damaging frost may occur as early as 11 P. M., 
this warning will sometimes give only three hours in 
which to flood. Frost flooding can be done on many bogs 
in this time, but it takes several hours more on most of 
the larger areas with their present flumes and canals. 
Many growers would profit by greatly enlarging these 
equipments so as to flood more quickly and make full 
use of the warnings obtained by the new method.
