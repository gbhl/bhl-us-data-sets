expected from last winter's mildness and this season's 
wetness. 
The egg parasitism (Trichogramma) was much 
less than usual and the Phanerotoma parasite also 
seems reduced. 
The worms hatched late. Because of this and the 
reduced parasitism, we may be surprised by the work 
they do yet before the berries are picked. 
THE BLACK-HEAD FIREWORM 
(Rhopobota vacciniana (Pack).) 
This pest also was less harmful than I ever saw it 
before. The second brood seemed to be entirely sup- 
pressed on some bogs. On others, it started hatching 
freely, but, for some cause, perhaps disease, as a rule 
faded out without doing much damage. 
We may yet greatly change our spraying program 
for this insect. The objections to the present treat- 
ment are : 
1. The Mechanical Injury done to the Vines in 
Spraying. This is a great damage and is a far more 
important matter than the cost of either the insecticide 
or its application. Possibly we can avoid it largely in 
the two following ways: 
(a) By using high-pressure power-spraying out- 
fits with open nozzles. This kind of outfit has been de- 
veloped to a high efficiency for spraying trees from the 
ground by the gypsy moth experts. It wastes materials 
somewhat, but with it one could spray an ordinary 
cranberry bog section completely by walking along 
the middle once and spraying from side to side. The 
sidewise dragging of the hose over the Vines thus 
would be eliminated and the tramping reduced to a 
minimum. 
(b) By spraying to kill the moths instead of the 
worms. The new cranberry growth is easily hurt in 
spraying until mid-July. From then on it hardens rap- 
idly. This' hardening is usually noticeable when the 
first brood of moths emerges, and when the second 
appears the vines will bear tramping with relatively 
little hurt. As each worm brood precedes its moths, 
the worms work at times in which the injury done in 
spraying is comparatively great.

acre per application to spray with ''Black Leaf 40" at
