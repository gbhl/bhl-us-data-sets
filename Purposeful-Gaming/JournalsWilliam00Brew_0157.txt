Oct. 6.
 Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Cloudy all day with steady rain most of
the time. Wind N.W. through A.M. N.E. to S.
E. in P.M. very light all day. Weather
rather warm. Off at 8 A.M. to marshes
about Outlet. A flock of about a dozen
Swallows one H. horreorum the rest Y.
bicolor. A perfect cloud Titlarks, at.
least 200 circling over the marshes
alighting and rising again. Down the
river some 300 yds. came upon two Yringa
maculata sitting on a mat of floating
grass. Within ten yards of them was 
a red Phalarope sometimes swimming,
sometimes walking on the grass. Shot 
the Phalarope. The Grass Birds flew off
and pitched down near the Outlet.
Going to the spot we flushed a flock
of ten. I killed eight of them in a 
few minutes several singly flying. They
were absurdly tame. Heard a Snipe
near Moose Point came on three Greater
Scaup Ducks. They were in the grass
and rose out of range going into
Leonards Pond. Followed them but failed
to find them. Came on a Green-winged
Teal, however, behind the island and
paddling within 30 yds. shot it as it
sat on a snag preening its feathers.
Our boat was grassed at the time.
When the Scanp Ducks rose a Snipe
also started near us and I shot it.
Afterward saw three at Moose Point. They
