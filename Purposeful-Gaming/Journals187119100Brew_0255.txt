1886
(Nov. 10)
greatly in excess of the Snow Buntings at (least 20 to 1)
I suspect that it is not late enough for the Long spurs.
  While on this hill looking off over the sea
I made out many Ducks, the majority flying well
out beyond the bar, looking like weather of smoke
in the distance. Immediately below in the smooth
water within a few yards of shore thru Old Squaws
were fishing within fifty yards of a gang of men
at work making a road. I descended and by
running when the Ducks were under and stopping
where they rose, got within at 40 yds. and shot
both barrels at them. All three dove and coming
up well out were soon whirled out to sea by the tide.
One of them died before he got out of sight but then
other two were apparently unhurt. There were also two
orud Grebes sailing along near shore. From the 
hill I could distinctly see the Old Squaws for several
yards under water when they dove. They went down
very swiftly and at an angle, not vertically.
  Returning to the boat we crossed the river
and sought shelter from the rain, which had begun
to fall heavily, in a small shanty. After waiting awhile
we decided to push on up river which we did in
the teeth of a westerly storm, the rain falling incessantly
until we had nearly reached town.  We passed several
larger flocks of Herring Gulls which seemed to realize
that I had packed my gun away in its case for 
they allowed us to get within 40 yds before flying
they presented a beautiful sight sitting in duck warms
on the mud flats. There were hundreds of Crows, also,
flying high overhead towards Rowley when they on
laid to have a roost.
