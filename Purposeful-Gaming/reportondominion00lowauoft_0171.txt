when in the vicinity of Cape Walker, to penetrate to the south- 
ward and westward in a course as direct as possible to Bering 
strait. A quick passage appears to have been made through 
Lancaster sound to Wellington channel, up which the ships 
sailed to the seventy-seventh parallel, and then down again on 
the west side of Cornwallis island, returning eastward to winter 
at Beechey island. Many traces of a winter residence were 
found there, including sites of workshops, forge and observa- 
tory. Over 700 empty meat cans, all labelled ' Goldner's 
Patent,' were found piled in regular mounds. A large quantity 
of similar tins supplied to the navy had been found to be putrid, 
and were condemned. This had probably happened to the tins 
left at Beechey island, and helped to hasten the starvation of 
the unfortunate crews two winters later. Three seamen died 
during the first winter, and were buried on the island. The 
next information concerning the fate of Franklin was obtained 
from a brief record, found on King William island by 
M'Clintock, in 1859. The record is as follows : ' Lieutenant 
Graham Gore and Mr. Charles F. des Voeux, mate, left the ships 
on Monday, the 24th of May, 1847, with six men (to deposit 
papers on King William's island) ' ' H.M. ships Erebus and 
Terror wintered in the ice in latitude 70 5' N., longitude 
98 23' W. Having wintered in 1846-47 at Beechey island in 
latitude 74 43' 28" n., longitude 91 31' 15" W. After hav- 
ing ascended Wellington channel to latitude 77, returned by 
the west side of Cornwallis island, (Sir) John Franklin com- 
manding the expedition. All well.' This was the original 
record, and a most mournful addition was made to it, on the 
25th of April, 1848, after another winter in the ice. Here is 
the addition: ' (1)848. H.M. ships Terror and Erebus were 
deserted on the 22nd April, 5 leagues nn. W. of this-(hav)- 
ing been beset since 12th Sept., 1846. The officers & crews
