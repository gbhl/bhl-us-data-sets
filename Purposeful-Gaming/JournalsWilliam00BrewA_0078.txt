haunted bushes which hung low over the [?]
where they flitted about among the terminal
twigs their yellow heads gleaming like gold
among the foliage or showing in strong contrast
against the dark water. I shot one fine orange
headed male. Parulas & Yellow-throated Warblers
were numerous as usual. Saw a pair of [?].
As I was paddling slowly and silently across a
broad pool when the sunlight brought out a
sand bar beneath with great distinctness I 
suddenly discovered a huge alligator gliding slowly
under the canoe at nearly a right angle. As I had not
time to shoot ahead & escape him I suspended
my paddle & sat perfectly still until he passed 
out of sight into deeper water on my left. His
back must have nearly grazed my keel & he
was not less than twelve feet in length with
a bulk nearly equal to that of a small pony.
  In the overarched portions of this creek I
found several pairs of Yellow crowned Herons
& saw several of their nests. On one which was
placed on a branch of an ash low over the creek
a bird was sitting but on climbing above the
nest I found it empty. I shot a bird here
& another on my return down the creek.
  As I turned back twilight was settling over 
the swamp & it was nearly dark before I 
reached the river. Barred Owls were hooting
on every side & the Yellow-crowned Herons squawking
& yelling far & near. Several of the latter came
close past me & one alighted within ten yards
A few Rail voices (probably of R. elegans) in the
marsh at the mouth of the creek.
