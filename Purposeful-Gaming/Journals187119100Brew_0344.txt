1887
Sept. 1  
Clear and a perfect day with almost no wind.
    Reached the Lake last night, going to Lakeside.
Early this morning was taken over to the Lake House
but found that Mrs. R. had been ill with something
suspiciously near typhoid fever so returned to Lakeside
and settled down there.
    Mr. Betton and their friends were here when I           
arrived and spent to-day shooting Woodcock. 
They bagged nine in the run behind Norse's, one
behind Frosts, and one in Sargents clearing in
Cambridge. They thought  they stacked about eighteen
in all.

  I spent the afternoon unpacking and arranging 
my things.
  At the Lake House saw several flocks of Corssbills
and Pine Linnets and a Sphyrapicus.
Sept. 2  
Cloudy with heavy rain in the afternoon.
    In the forenoon paddled down nearly to the
Lake House examining the Marshes & coves by the way.
Saw absolutely no waders or water birds. There were
numerous Savanna Sparrows in the marsh but nothing           
else. The air was very still and from the distant                           
woods came many notes of small birds. Heard
two Red eyed Vireo and one Solitary singing. Also
heard Crossbills, Pine Linnets, Yellow-rumps, several
Red and one White-bellied nuthatch & numerous Woodpeckers
including one Hylotonnus. On a tall shrub near the
river a Contopus borealis was perched, calling at
frequent intervals.
