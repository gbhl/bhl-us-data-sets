1886
July 20
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and sultry.
  Drove to Cambridge in the afternoon,
leaving Concord at 1:30 p.m.

  It was sultry afternoon with thunder
heads gathering in the west, the leaves drooping
in the woods, very few birds singing. I 
heard only a few Vireos (V. olivacius) and a 
Savager in the Sandy Pond woods, are 
Indigo by the roadside, and a Meadow Lark
in a newly crown field.
  In the woods bordering Sandy Pond a 
cock Grouse was standing erect and still
on the side of the road. He permitted us 
to get within about 50 yds, then stalked
slowly across the dusty track and into
the brush, flirting his tail and shaking his
ruffs and each step. I saw what was
doubters the same bird in the same place
April 27 and on surreal occasion mice.

  On the way to Cambridge I could not
find Rhus typhinea until well into Waltham.
This only species I can discover in Concord
(except the two poisonous ones) in R. glabra
which is abundant everywhere. Chicory , also
waiting in Concord, began at about the 
same point in Waltham.
  Curiously enough I have heard only one
Cicada this season (on July 18). It is nearly
time they come flying in the tree tops.
