SUMMER CRUISE 69 
natives would be put ashore at Kings cape and the remainder 
at the mica mine, where the results of the season's mining, some 
thirteen tons, would be taken on board,. together with the white 
men there, and the ship would leave for home about the 1st of 
October. 
The Era had been met in Repulse bay, and had at that time 
not added to her catch since we left Fullerton. Captain Comer 
was again to winter in Fullerton harbour, and was on his way 
south to go into winter quarters. Including the crew, the 
Active had one hundred and twenty-three persons on board; 
the ship is quite small, and the accommodation and crowding 
can be imagined. 
Fullerton was reached next morning, and we were soon 
boarded by the police detachment and our old Eskimo friends 
of the past winter. During our absence Staff-Sergeant Dee had 
made an exciting trip to Repulse bay in a whaleboat manned by 
natives. 
The day after our arrival the Era entered the harbour, and 
Captain Comer reported the lack of success mentioned above. 
We remained at Fullerton until the 25th, being busily em- 
ployed in the meantime with landing provisions and coals for 
the police, shifting coal, and taking aboard ballast. Two of the 
policemen who had been left here in the spring were found to 
be seriously ill, and on the doctor's certificate were taken on 
board invalided home. 
The homewafd voyage from Fullerton to Port Burwell was 
made in fine weather, and the only incident requiring mention 
was that the ice from Fox channel had advanced southward and 
westward nearly twenty miles since we last saw it. This neces- 
sitated our keeping close to Mansfield island. Our pilot was 
safely returned to his home in Wakeham bay, and Port Burwell 
was reached on the 1st of October.
