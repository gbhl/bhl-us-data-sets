kok kok etc. "Rain Crow"  note coming in every
now & then from the open water. As there were
several Greebes (P. podiceps) there I am inclined
to think them the authors, not the Coots as I
thought on the 18th. The cry is precisely like that
made by the Greebes on Crooked L., Mich., last
May. Am very sure I disentangled the notes
of the Fla. Gallinules to-day. They utter a wha-wha
who-who etc in a descending scale. It closely
resembles the spring call of Rallus virginianus.
  Spent the p.m. beating the bonnets etc back
towards the Lake shooting two Coots, two Gallinules,
a Blue Heron (ad A. caerulea) and a female Blue-wing
Teal on the way. The Teal was one of a pair
that rose from the bonnets ahead of the boat.
Saw eight or ten others in pairs & threes, the
males in full plumage.
  Near the mouth of the river found forty or
fifty small Herons mostly adult A. caerulea with
a sprinkling of white birds, probably the young,
and a good many A. ludoviciana. Lay in
wait for them at an alleged "roost" in some willows
but did not get a shot.
  Saw nearly 100 Ducks about 50 in one flock.
They looked like Scaups. Some others I took
to be Hooded Mergansers.
  Boat-tailed Grackles numerous about the
beds of cane. Saw one Water Turkey (Plotus)
sitting on a stake. Several Marsh Hawks scaling
about & two or three Bitterns flushed from the
cane. A few White-bellied Swallows. Coots dotting
the water everywhere but no beds of them.
  Got back to the hotel about 7 p.m.
