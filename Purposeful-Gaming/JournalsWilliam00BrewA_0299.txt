Lake Umbagog, Maine.
one morning at day break and wounded one
of them which left the others and flew
low and feebly but out of sight over the 
woods. He has not known so many Geese
to alight in the Lake for many years.
Curiously enough neither he nor anyone else
has seen any Scoters in the thatch of Lake
between Lakeside and Great Island this
autumn. Indeed Mr. Sweat has seen only
two Ducks in this part of the Lake since
Sept. 1st. He tells me that for the first four
years after he bought his present farm
(1870-1874) Sheldrake, Whistlers, Mergansers and 
a good many Black Ducks used to resort 
daily in autumn to the cove between his
place and Sargents. He often saw several
hundred in this cove at one time and
killed a great many in the course of each
autumn. During these years the evening
flights through the narrows were very
heavy and he has known [three?] guns to 
kill twenty birds there in a single evening.
