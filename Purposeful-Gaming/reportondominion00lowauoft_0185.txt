HISTORICAL SUMMARY 111 
mapping of Jones sound and the western side of Ellesmere 
island, the discovery of a large island lying on the west side of 
Ellesmere island, and two other large islands in latitude 79, 
extending westward to longitude 106 W., which is that of the 
eastern side of Melville island, while North Cornwall and Find- 
lay islands were seen to the south. To the westward and north- 
ward no signs of land were seen, and the ancient Arctic ice was 
found pressing on the coasts of these new northern islands, so 
that the line of drift pressure can now be traced from Bering 
sea to the east coast of Greenland.
