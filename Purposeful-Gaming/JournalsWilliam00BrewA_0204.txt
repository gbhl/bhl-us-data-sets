Piping Plover and a Bonaparte's Sandpiper and Black-bellied
Plover besides Greater Yellow-legs & Upland Plover occasionally
whistling over the plains towards Katama. Early in the 
forenoon I packed the canoe and started down the harbor
paddling along the shore of the beach. The waders just
mentioned were stretched along the water's edge in lines
and little clusters as far as the eye could reach. Most
of them were feeding but some were asleep standing on one
or both legs with bills buried in feathers of the back. In
the same space I have never seen more large Waders at
once. The Snipe were almost or quite as numerous as the
Peep. I saw two Numenius hudsonicus flying together
over the water.
  Landed near the beacon and spent the afternoon & night
on a strip of bare, white land where many Least Terns
were breeding. Found four nests, 4, 2, 2, & 1 eggs respectively,
there being a toddling little chick, which the parents fed
at frequent intervals, near the nest with one egg. Photographed 
all the nests and spent much time watching the birds
through the glass but did not take any of the eggs.
After an hour or two the birds ceased to mind my
presence as long as I kept still and I could watch
at my ease all four sitting on their eggs within sixty
yds of my position.
  The night was cool with strong E. wind the moon
peeping out occasionally through drifting clouds. A thunder
shower passed over the sea to the S. the distant claps
of thunder mingling with incessant roar of the surf
on the beach. The Least Terns were perfectly silent after
it got dark except when I moved about when they
would start as quickly as in the daytime. No waders
flying after 8 P.M. Some Snipe passed the night near me.
A few Warblers migrating.
