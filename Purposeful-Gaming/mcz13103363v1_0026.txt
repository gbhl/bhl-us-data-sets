Yellow Crowned Warbler
[margin]April 28.[/margin]
  Saw a pair, the only noise
that I heard them make
was a weak feeble chirp, they
were black, white, and
yellow above, the breast
striped with bands of 
black and white, they 
were quite tame and
we could have shot them
easily had we had our
guns; they are said to be
very common in spring, but 
they breed north of here

  Saw a large flock of Gold-
Finches of both sexes, there
must have been at least 50 
of them and they filled
the air with their music.
