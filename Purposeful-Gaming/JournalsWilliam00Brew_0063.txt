1888
May 25
Oden, Michigan
Cloudy most of the day with occasional intervals of sunshine.
Wind N. E. Rather cool.
  After inspecting the coves about the house this morning
and finding them nearly deserted we took boat and
started for a day on the Lake. Crossed first to the
great island. A Pine Warbler singing there; also many
D. virens, Parula am., Ixoreus naevius & Vireo olivaceus. On
the further side we started a flock of Sheldrake (M. serrator)
which came past us down wind at a great speed. I selected
a drake which started off at my shot and finally fell
dead 100 yds. or more to leeward. He proved a rather
ragged & worthless specimen not in full plumage.
  Crossing to the mainland on the S. east shore I shot
a Red-wing among some willows. It is the only bird
of the species that we have seen here. A Swamp Sparrow
was singing in the willows.
  Further east we landed at a log cabin and went
back a little way into the woods. No birds of any interest.
Saw fresh deer tracks. Just before landing I saw a mink
peep out among some logs & draw back in again.
  Skirting the shore a mile or so further we heard
many Water Thrushes, Canada Warblers, Parulas, an Olive-back
& several Hermit Thrushes & many Red eyed Vireos. Reaching
the mouth of Pickerel River we rowed through to
Pickerel Lake. It proved very like Crooked Lake but
wilder, nothing but woods on every side the trees along
the shores chiefly arbor vitae & larches with a few spruces,
further back on the higher ground beeches, maples &
white pines. We eat lunch here sitting in the boat.
Toads, Rana palustris & Hy;as singing on every side.
A Swamp Sparrow trilling & numerous Water Thrushes
