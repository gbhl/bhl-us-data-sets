1886
Sept. 9
Concord, Massachusetts.
Clear and warm
  On the river this evening from sunset to 9 P.M.
The night clear and still with a nearly full
moon. Warbler migrating in numbers that I 
have never known equaled in Mass. before. The air
was literally full of them. I could often hear
four or five at once.  There were no Thrushes or
other birds calling.  I must have heard at least 
200 Warblers in two hours. The bulk were probably
D. Striata but this is only a guess.

Sept. 12
  Morning clear with high wind. P.M cloudy with light
showers.
  Down river to Ball's Hill with Melvin at 3 P.M.
Saw three or four Buteo borealis, two Circus, a Black Duck,
three Wood Ducks, and a Bittern besides a Kingfishes.
At Ball's Hill five Chimney Swifts, evidently migrating,
passed over at bright of fully 1000 ft. heading 
directly south.
