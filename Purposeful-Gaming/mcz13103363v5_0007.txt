Rose at 7 A.M. &
getting Bill up, had
Tiger harnessed. Took
a ride with Dan up
to Belmont & down
by Mt. Auburn.
The sleighing was very
good. Did not get
home till 8.15 &
consequently got late 
to school. Wrote our
second Greek Comp. paper
today. Per. - Studied
at the R's immediately
after getting back from

Tuesday, January 5, 1869.
  Cloudy & foggy.
Cleared up at sunset.
Ther. about 40[degrees] - 46[degrees] - 
35[degrees]. Rose as usual.
Walked down to school
with Farrar & J. Croswell.
Got late and a "blowing"
in consequence.
  After getting back from
school had lunch as
usual. Then R. Deane
called and I had Tiger
harnessed. Rode first
over into Brookline
& Brighton; saw six
or seven Pine Grosbeaks.
Then came back through
the square and kept
on up the avenue to
Spy Pond. Came home
around Fresh Pond. The
sleighing was rather poor
as in many places the
ground was bare.
