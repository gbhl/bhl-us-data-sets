1889
(May 29)
Reed-wings were singing there and doubtless their mates were sitting
on their nests in the floating island. A boy on a raft was
catching small gold-fiish with a dip net.
  Crossing the road I heard a House Wren sing and shot both
him and his mate. The pitch pine knoll on French's Hill was very
beautiful the undergrowth having become much denser since my last
visit. An Indigo Bird was singing in the great white oak, a Tanager (the same
heard previously in the cemetery woods) in a piitch pine, a Pine Warbler in the
distance and several Black-polls on various sides. There was also a Minotilla
in full song. I flushed a [male] D. caerulescens from the ground and found the
nest of the Indigo in a wild cherry thicket. It held one egg only.
  The cedar belt beyond held only a Redstart or two, a Song Sparrow and
a [female] Indigo. A Warbling Vireo was singing in the valley to the South, a Purple
Finch in the cedar pasture where I found several nests in 1869 (or 1870!)
  Next crossed to the "hog's back" near the Arsenal heaing a Warbling ZVireo
in the silver-leafed poplars on the way. On the "hog's back" heard a Wood
Pewee, a Vireo flavifrons, and several Redstarts & Least Flycatchers. A Cat-bird (the
only one noted to-day) a Grothlypis trichas, a Kingbird, and several Red-wings
were seen or heard in the alder swamp to the east. A Red-start's
nest in a tall alder, very conspicuously placed. I bent the bush down
& found a Cow-bird's egg & one of the Redstart. The latter jumped out as
I let the bush back. A fine gray squirrel, very tame, running on the
ground in these woods.
  In the extensive oak & chestnut woods across the railroad heard several
Wood Pewees & Red-eyed Vireos. A Grass Finch singing in the fields outside.
Near the trap-shooting house two pairs of Indigo Birds & a single [male]; one of
the [females] building. No Wilson's Thrushes anywhere to-day. I expected them
confidently in the Arsenal woods, no Bobolinks - Only one Pine Warbler.
  Robins & orioles, Chipping Sparrows, Cedar Birds, Redstarts, Redeyed
& yellow-throated Vireos, Least Flycatchers & Kingbirds fully as numerous as
20 years ago. Only two Cuckoos; About three Flickers, a pair of White-bellied
Swallows near Mt. Auburn, Woods in full summer foliage. 41 species.
