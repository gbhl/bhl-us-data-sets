Thursday, November 4, 1869.
  Clear and so warm
as to be actually oppressive.
Ther. about 50[degrees] - 70[degrees] - 
60[degrees]. Rose as usual.
After breakfast H. Hen-
shaw came up, and we
went off with the team.
Tied in Waltham and
shot several Fox Colors
and two gray squirrels.
Saw a Brown Thrush.
The air was perfectly
still, the sky cloudless,
and the day about as
perfect as could be
imagined.
  Got home at about
4 P.M. and went out
on the farm but did
not get anything but a
Fox Color.
Harpochyncus Rufus, saw
one in Waltham.

In A.M. went into
Boston and saw
Dr. Derby who gave
me a bottle of new
medicine. Called
on H. Purdie and
talked with him about
half-an-hour.
  Took lunch at Smith's
and had my hair cut.
  After getting home
rode up into Waltham
in search of my fur
mitten which I thought
I had lost. (Found it afterwards
at home).
Trog. Hyemalis, took a
male.
