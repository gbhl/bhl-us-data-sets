ANNUAL CEREMONY OF THE PAWNEE MEDICINE MEN 3 
The religious ceremonies of the Pawnee were of 
two sorts, ceremonies which centered around the sacred 
bundles and were participated in by the whole village, 
band, or tribe, and ceremonies which were performed 
by societies whose members had some secret in com- 
mon. In the ceremonies of the first class, the most im- 
portant of which have been described in Leaflets 5-7, 
an appeal was made primarily to the great heavenly 
deities. In the ceremonies of the second class, the 
appeal was made to the less powerful, but more inti- 
mate earthly gods who were believed to have bestowed 
power upon the performers. Among the ceremonies 
of the second class, those of the medicine men were 
the most important. 
In every Indian tribe there were a number of per- 
sons, called medicine men by the whites, who were 
regarded as the possessors of supernatural powers 
which enabled them to recognize and cure disease. 
They were believed to have received their powers from 
some supernatural being either as a direct gift or as 
the result of instruction by some person who had re- 
ceived such powers. Although they frequently em- 
ployed sleight of hand and other trickery to impress the 
uninitiated, many of them believed that they really 
possessed the powers attributed to them, and performed 
their ceremonies in good faith. In some cases they 
combined the functions of a shaman or priest with that 
of a healer, and thus exercised great influence over 
the people. In most of the populous tribes they were 
organized into guilds or societies. 
Among the Pawnee, the medicine men ranked 
socially next to the chiefs and priests. They usually 
wore a distinctive costume consisting of a buffalo robe 
with the hair out, a bear's-claw necklace, and a cap of 
beaver skin. They also wore charms or amulets con- 
sisting of the tail and claws of the wild cat, badger, or 
bear, bear's ears, miniature pipes, and downy feathers,
