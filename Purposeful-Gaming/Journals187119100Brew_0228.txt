1886
Oct.1
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and cool with strong, gusty N.W. wind.
  Down river for the day with Friends and
Henshaw, taking both Rushton boats.
  We landed first at Hott's neck and beat the
Swipe ground without starting anything a matter
of little surprise for us found that surreal other 
sportsmen had anticipated us.  One, a cripple hobbling
about on crutches and working a pointer, had
flushed two Swipe and killed one.
  We sailed the remainder of the way to the 
meadow below Ball's Hioll where we landed and
took to the woods. For nearly and hour we scoured
upland and swamp without seeing anything saw
an occasional Jay. At length as we were sitting
on the ground on the edge of the some birches a Gros Hawk
suddenly appeared nearly over us.  He saw us and 
instantly turned scaling low over the trees and 
was about to disappear when fired and brought
him to the ground.  It was quick work but I
happened to have my gun in hand at just the 
right moment. I also killed a fine Blue Jay
near the same place making a [?] shot at it
as it crossed an opening. These were the only shots
fired in the woods. We saw nothing else except 
a Carolina Dove in an old field. The Gros Hawlk
was undoubtedly one of the brood seen last month
and in August in the same woods.
  We launched on the edge of the meadow and 
then started for home. Saw nothing in ten
river except a Grub and a Teal. Jones brought
down the latter but it crawled into the reeds and
