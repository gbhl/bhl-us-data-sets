SHRUNKEN KERNEL MAIZE EARS BRED FROM PONKA INDIAN CORN 
Among some maize seeds obtained from the Ponka Indians of Nebraska in 1914 were some that 
were deeply indented at the top and some indented on the sides, as though the endosperm had 
shrunken causing the sides to fall in. When these seeds were planted they were found to breed 
true, and subsequent tests have shown this condition to be inherited. (Fig. 20.)
