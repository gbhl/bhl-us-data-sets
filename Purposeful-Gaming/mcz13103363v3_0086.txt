50弉��62弉��51�.
Went to church and sabbath
school in the A.M. In P.M.
took a ride through and round
Mt. Auburn with father
and mother getting home
at 6 P.M. Stayed out in the
garden till 8.10 P.M. The
canker worms have nearly stripped
some of the apple trees. The grass is
nearly long enough to cut &
some of the clover is lodged. The
green currants are very large
& the lilac blossoms are about
used up. All the leaves seem
to be fully out.

  Clear and a most lovely
day. Rather chilly. Ther[mometer] about
55弉��62弉��52�.
Rose at 6 A.M. and got two
eggs from the y[el]l[ow] b[I]ll[ed] cuckoo's
& two from the Bl[ac]k b[I]ll[ed] cuckoo's
found Saturday back of the
Russell's putting a robin's
egg in the place of each. Had
my hair cut on the way from
school. R[uth] Deane called on the
way from school & stayed about
30 minutes. Went egging through
Watertown in the P.M. taking my
blow gun & found a chickadee's
just finished & a cuckoo's nearly so.
Got home at 7.45 P.M. Went
up to the Russell's in the evening.
Went up to see J[ohn] Nichols after dinner
as he has had two more carbuncles.
