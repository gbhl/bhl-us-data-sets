1886
Aug.10
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and hot with strong S.W.wind
  In the forenoon drove to  Pantry Brook meadow in
Sudbury, interceding to get a Marsh Robbin or two if
possible. Found two singing near the road but did
not attempt to shoot them as several gangs of men
were at work in the meadow, haying. They have
already cut at least our third of the grass and
the Marsh Robbin chances of leaving young seem
slender indeed.

  Returning I crossed Lee's Bridge and beat the
meadow on the east side of the river when I heard
a Marsh Robbin four time ago. He was not singing and 
I could not find him at first but after I had
given up the search and returned to the buggy he
began to sing vigorously. I went to the shot and
discovered him in a thicket of low bushes about 
under my feet. I had to flush him but I killed
him with the litter 32 cal. pistol as he was skimming
off over the tall grass.
  Returned to town by way of Walden Pond. During
the entire drive heard only one bird singing, a
Bluebird.
  After dinner took Larner and beat their cover
on Ripley's Hill thoroughly but failed to start the
Woodcock seen them yesterday. Shot into a flock
of Blackbirds away the pines and killed them
two of them Cow Blackbirds, the third a young
Red-wing.

  Out of the river with C. in the evening
sailing down to Dakin's Hill and sowing back
in the moonlight. Heard an Upland Plover
