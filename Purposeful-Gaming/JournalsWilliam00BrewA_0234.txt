1890.
Sept. 25.
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
  Clear and much warmer with rather strong S.W. wind, a delight
ful day without a cloud from sunrise until sunset.
  Off with H. at 8.30 A.M. taking the buckboard and old John and
driving to Pearley White's. Beat all around the edge of the cover
behind the barn and started a large Woodcock three times but fail-
ed to get a shot at ia*[it]. Then followed the wood edge down the [delete]road[/delete]
hill to the little meadow where we shot the Lincoln's Finches yes-
terday. There were no Sparrows here to-day but we started a Conn-
ecticut Warbler from some mountain maples on the edge of the woos
and H. shot it. It is the first that has been taken in this region.

  We next crossed the cart path and beat a very extensive tract 
of alders, maples, poplars and spruces, low springy ground which
seemed in perfect condition for Woodcock. We found one bird at
which we both shot nearly together but both missed. I killed a
beautiful Lincoln's Finch here. It started from the ground in a 
pasture on the edge of a strip of maples in one of which it aligh-
ted sitting perfectly still until I killed it.

  We saw a good many Robins and great numbers of Yellowrumps but
not half as amny Sparrows as yesterday and only four Flickers.
  In the afternoon we took old John again and drove to J. Brown's
stopping on the way in front of C. Brown's where H. killed a very
large Woodcock. It lay in the little isolated clump o*[of] maples near
the road and I drove it out to H. 
  At J. Brown's we tried first the alders above the house. Find-
ing nothing there we crossed the road and descended the hill to
the dense spruce cover where I made a double shot at Woodcock last
year.
