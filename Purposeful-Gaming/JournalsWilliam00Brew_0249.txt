Feb. 24
Banana River to Titusville, Fla
Clear with strong cool N. to N.E. wind.
  Early this morning we engaged Henry
to take us to Titusville in his flat bottomed, square
ended boat a sloop rigged vessel of fair [?] but
only 10 inches draught. While waiting for breakfast
C. shot an alligator from the deck of the Manatu.
It rose at intervals of about two minutes, first
showing the eye & nose only, then slowly rearing 
the entire head above the surface, finally sinking 
beneath the water. It measured exactly 8 ft.11in.
  Beat much of the way through the creek against
a strong wind. Coots in beds of acres at frequent 
intervals. [?] [?] the largest bed at fully 
100 000 birds. "Good" Ducks (chiefly Widgeon & Pintails
with a sprinkling of Gadwals also very numerous
rising in clouds at times. Large flocks of
Yellow legs; Willet, Kildeer etc. along the shores.
At the mouth of the creek the water was 
black with Coots & Duck, as far as the eye 
could reach. Just outside the mouth saw
a fine Duck Hawk realing about.
