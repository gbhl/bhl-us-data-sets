Wednesday, April 24, 1867.
  Cloudy all day. Began to snow
at about 1 P.M. and for a half-
an-hour the snow fell about
as thick and fast as I ever
saw it before, the flakes being
very large. Alternately rained
and snow during the P.M.
Ther. about [degrees] - [degrees] - 37[degrees].
Went to ride on Tiger in P.M. as it
ceased to storm for a little while.
Rode up beyond Fresh pond and
back again. Saw over a thousand
barn & white bellied swallows on
'the pond'. Went to Glacalis
after musk rats starting at 6 P.M. Fired
at one. Heard some snipe. Got home
quite wet at 8 P.M. Was invited up to
take tea at the Deane's but did not go.
Studied part of evening. Seven gulls were
seen on Fresh pond. Bought fathers hens
and 8ï¿½_ lbs. of oats. Chippy seen building.
Thursday, April 25, 1867.
  Clear most of the day but rather
misty. Ther. about 40[degrees] - 62[degrees]
 - 42[degrees] Got up a little before
breakfast and fed my hens.
They laid five eggs today.
When I got home from school
went up to the Russell's and
looked at their hens. Played ball
with J. Coffin for a little while. Then
went up to the Deane's and saw Dan.
They had found a crow's nest with 4 eggs.
On the way to school saw a purple finch
with a mouth full of straws. Dan & Ruth
came down in P.M. and then went home
to Waltham. Went to ride in P.M. with
Washy. through Belmont & Waverly.
Cleaned my gun when I  got home.
Got out my Latin at home. Began the
2nd Book Caesar today. Grass as green
as it will be in many fields.
Bluebird seen (by R. Deane) building in a cliff
swallows nest.
