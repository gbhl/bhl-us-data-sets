Riverside, Massachusetts
Hunt for nest of Protonotaria
  Clear and warm with light W to SW wind. A beautiful
June day.
  Met Kennard by appointment at Riverside at 9 am.
Taking a boat we rowed down stream to the lagoon
where he shot the Prothonotary on the 20th and spent
most of the morning looking for its nest. The wooded
point, partially overflowed, between the lagoon and river
is in every way a typical breeding haunt and there
were plenty of birch stubs, some with old Woodpeckers' 
holes, in which it might have nested but we failed
to find the nest although we opened every hole and 
pulled down every stub that we could find. Probably
the bird was a wanderer that had no nest or mate, 
but if so it is curious that he should have spent
at least five days in one spot. 
  As on yesterday there were great numbers of common birds
singing everywhere along the river, Cat-birds, Vireos (olivaceus
et flavifrons) Cuckoos (both species) Wood Pewees, Phoebes, 
a Tanager, Red-wings, Wilson's Thrushes etc.
  Returned to Cambridge by 12.10 train.
While passing the Watertown Arsenal in the cars on the
Boston and Albany R. R. I saw a Sparrow Hawk [?]
over the salt marsh with 20 yds of the train
