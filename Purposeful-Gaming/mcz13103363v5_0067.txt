Rose at 5 A.M. Having
Tiger harnessed rode up

  Shot a Yl. Wing, woodpeckers
spoilt him; then a Yl. Rump
& Sol. Vireo; put them in the 
wagon: going off again upon
coming back found Tiger loose
& up to his neck in water.  Had
to cut the harness to pieces to get 
him out. Put him in a barn
& getting a man to help, pulled
out the wagon & brought it home
in a hay rigging. One wheel 
was smashed & another & the shaft
bent. Chrysomitres Pinus, saw
