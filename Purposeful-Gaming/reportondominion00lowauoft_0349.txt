same manner as in more southern regions of similar rocks; in 
fact, specimens of the more important minerals are reported 
from the north. 
gold.-the occurrence of gold is reported only from the head 
of Wager inlet, Where specimens of free gold were found in the 
dark rocks of that locality by Dr. rae. 
The presence of large areas of undisturbed Tertiary sands 
and clays in the northern part of Baffin island and elsewhere 
are favourable to the accumulation of placer gold deposits, if 
the precious metal occurs in the underlying Laurentian and 
Huronian rocks. It would be well to test the beds of the streams 
flowing through these deposits when they are again visited. 
silver.-a small quantity of silver is found in the galena, 
which occurs in pockets in the limestone along the Whale river 
coast on the east side of Hudson bay. The amount of galena 
is small, and so Widely scattered that it would probably be un- 
profitable to mine even in favourable circumstances. 
copper.-tyrrell discovered large masses of Huronian rocks 
along the western shores of Hudson bay, to the south of Marble 
island. In these were many bands and masses of dark schists, 
all carrying quantities of iron and copper sulphides. Of these 
deposits he reports as follows : ' At a point northeast of rabbit 
island the character of the shore changes, and dark-green 
Huronian schists crop out from beneath the boulders/ 
'north of rabbit island is a high point, on which the 
Eskimos are accustomed to camp while waiting for the traders 
from Churchill. The point is composed of green calcareous, 
chloritic schist, striking S. 55 W., and dipping N. 35 W. at 
an angle of 60. The schist is cut by a dike seventy-five feet 
Wide, of massive green, highly altered diabase, containing a 
large amount of mispickel. This diabase also outcrops along 
the shore, where it incloses many bands of
