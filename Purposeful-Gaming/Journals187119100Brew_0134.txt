1886
July 21
Concord, Massachusetts.
A dull cloudy day clearing shortly after 9 p.m. 
  Up the Assabet in the evening with P. starting at 
6.30, going as far as One-arch Bridge, and getting
back at 9 o'clock.

  Between Egg Rock and the Hemlocks we heard two
yellow warblers singing and saw six or eight now
flashing in the dark foliage of alders, maples etc., A
few song sparrows were singing along the river banks,
and somewhere in the distance, a Meadow Lark;
possibly a Robin or two, [?], and certainly one or
two Vireos (V. olivaceus) and a Maryland Yellow Throat,
but that was about all. Wilson's [?], Brow [?],
Chestnut-sided Warbles and Black & White [?] have
all [?] singing [?]. Several species of grasshoppers
and crickets are talking their places. The bull-frog
still triumphs, however, and the march-frog snaps his
violin string nearly as vigorously as in June. We
heard a single [?] [?] [?] the harsh summer
trill[?]. I have not noticed this cry before since June.

  In the meadow on the right back just above Birds-nest
Island a Henslow's Sparrow was singing steadily as
we passed on our way up (about 7.15) and to our great
surprise, equally steadily when we returned at 8.30
although the night was then nearly, if not quite, settled
down, the sky cloudy, and no light in the nest[?]. We
stopped and listened to him for several minutes and 
left him singing. It was to dark at the time that it 
was difficult to distinguish the river from its banks.

  At the Lowell R.R. bridge a Woodcock hustled overhead 
and dripped in a nearby hollow; he a had evidently come 
from some distant cover. We also saw Night Heron and
