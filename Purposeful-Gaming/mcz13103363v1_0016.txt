Saw two a red bellied and
a white bellied. The red
bellied Nuthatch, I saw
in a field near Fresh Pond
it made the same creaking
noise as a white bellied,
it flew in zigzag lines and
lit on a large tree, it ran up
a little way and then
commenced coming down-
wards upon the perpendicular 
trunk, a feat which but
few birds besides the Nuthatch
can accomplish. It is somewhat
smaller than a white bellied
Nuthatch and is blue above
and reddish yellow underneath
it was shot by D. F. and he
has it now in his collection.
It is said to be a very rare
bird and I believe it comes
only in winter.
  The white bellied Nuthatch I 
saw in an Elm Tree on the corner
of Mount auburn St. and Elm-
Wood Avenue it is like
the red bellied, capable
of running either up or down
the trunk of a tree. It is
somewhat larger than the
red bellie and is [delete]white[/delete]
of a bluish color above and
