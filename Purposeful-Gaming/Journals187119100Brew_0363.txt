1887
(Sept. 20)
not appear to notice us as we came around the bend.
Still further on we heard a Grouse run in the leaves.
Before we could catch sight of it it rose giving me
merely a glimpse of its form as it hurtled off among
the alders. I was lucky enough to bring it down by
a snap shot.

  We lunched at the folks and then pushed on into
the meadows going about halfway up. Signs of Ducks
were numerous, tracks and droppings on every shelving
shore and feathers scattered about on the water, some
of the feathers from Wood Ducks, others of Black Ducks,.
  Coming noiselessly around a bend we discovered a                             
Great Blue Heron standing leg deep in the stream.  He back       
was towards us and his head and neck, lowered close to                 
the water, were invisible.  He ran this boat to within less
than twenty yards of him before he raised his head
and saw us for the first time. His sudden spring into
the air, loud squawk of dismay, and frantic efforts to
move his big wings quickly were very ludicrous. A 
short distance ahead we surprised another which I
shot as I took it to be an adult.  It proved a young
bird, however.

  On the way back down the meadow we heard a                                    
Grouse rustle off from the bank among the alders.  Landing
I caught sight of its head & neck and fired but to my
surprise missed the bird which flew a moment later.  I
probable overshot it.

  Just below the forks I saw jets of water repeatedly                                 
fly up into the air on the other side of a sand bar in                                 
the river.  As we approached a Cooper's Hawk rose                               
from the waters edge & started off across the stream
giving me an easy shot.  It proved a young Bird,
nothing of interest on the rest of the way home.
