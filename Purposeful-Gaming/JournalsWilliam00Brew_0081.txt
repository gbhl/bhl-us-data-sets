June 9
Belmont, Massachusetts.
Clear and hot; wind S. W.
  At 11.30 A. M. started by buggy for Prospect St. with
Denton out chief object being to search for nests of the
Prairie Warbler. At the foot of Vassal Lane heard a Red-eye
a Least Flycatcher & a Yellow Warbler singing in the oak
woods, a Maryland Yellow-throat & several Swamp Sparrow
in the swamps. From Fresh Pond to Belmont heard several
Vireo gilous, two V. flavifrons, several Wood Peewees & a Red-start.
Barn Swallows entering the barn at the crossroads just
beyond Black's. The neighboring sand bank a pepper box
of Sand Swallows' holes but none of the birds about.
No Bobolinks or Meadow Larks on the Belmont meadows.

  Reaching the crest of the hill we tied the horse at
the big apple tree in Prospect St. A Mniotilta a Nashville
Warbler & a Cuckoo singing. Soon heard two Prairie Warblers
& began to search for their nests. I soon found one
in a barberry just over the wall on the south side of 
the road. It was a beauty but empty. D. found
what was apparently the beginning of one on the north
side and within ten yards a last year's nest, both
in barberries. I shot a young Brown Thrasher here.
  We lunched at the cold spring and then entered
the cedar woods. Several D. virens & an Indigo Bird
singing. Also a Pine Warbler whose mate, by great
good luck, I almost immediately saw fly to the
nest on which she was busily at work (at about 2 P. M.)
It was in the very top of a tall, slender pitch pine
very near the spot where I found a nest with young
some ten or twelve years ago. Perhaps it was by
the same birds. The [female] of this nest was apparently
as bright yellow beneath as the average [male]. I followed
