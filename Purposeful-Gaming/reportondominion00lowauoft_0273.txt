ESKIMOS 171 
keep away disease; a white piece of deerskin and thread are 
put on the ice for the same purposes. Seal bones must not be 
given to the dogs. The souls of the sea animals abhor dead 
bodies and blood^ which must therefore be avoided by hunters. 
This rule applies especially to women during their periods. 
Everybody in the encampment may eat freely of the seals killed 
by the successful hunter, but none of the meat must be removed 
from his house. 
During the deer hunt no work must be done with sealskin. 
The winter clothes and tents must be buried, while no seal or 
walrus line may be taken inland. When hunting deer from 
the kyak on the inland lakes a small piece of sealskin is de- 
posited under a stone on the margin of the lake. 
When the musk-ox hunt is in progress, the hair must not be 
removed from deerskins, and no work with iron may be under- 
taken. 
All deerskin garments must be made on the land, and not 
after the family has moved upon the ice, until the March 
moon, when the women are allowed to work at deerskins in an 
iglo on the land, but not on a day when a walrus has been 
killed. Soapstone is another material which must not be worked 
on the ice. No work may be undertaken on sealskins killed 
during the winter, until the seals have pupped. The tusks of 
freshly killed walrus must not be removed from the skull until 
the winter, but work may be done during the season on tusks 
taken before the new ice forms. 
When on the ice, deer meat must be taken into the house 
through a hole in the side and not by the door, until after the 
March moon, when both deerskins and meat may be taken 
through the door. Deer must not be eaten on the same day with 
seal or walrus, except in the walrus season, when it may be 
eaten with the latter. Clothing must be changed before eating 
seal in the walrus season.
