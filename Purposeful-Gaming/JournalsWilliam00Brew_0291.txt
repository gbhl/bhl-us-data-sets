May 11
Belmont, Mass.
Alternately cloudy and clear with light showers in forenoon. Wind E.
  Started for Belmont in the morning but it began to rain and
I returned. At 3 P. M. I started again and drove to Waverly,
then up by the mill ponds to and through the "Willows" and
home by way of Prospect Street. 
  At the "Willows" I got out and walked through to the

  Prospect Street as wild and beautiful as ever but the
deserted house on the summit reglazed and inhabited again.

in the thickets and among the ground juniper.
  Finished the afternoon by a walk through the mixed cedar &
[delete]yellow[/delete] pitch pine woods at the forks of the road. D. virens and
S. aurocapillus singing. A shy thrush wither swainsoni or some
form of aliciae flitting along a stone wall keeping well out
of range of my pistol. Several more White-throats.
  On the drive home heard two Emp. oni[?]us in the
