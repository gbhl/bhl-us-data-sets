1888
Sept. 15
Cloudless, cold at sunrise ice forming last
night. Middle of day hot but tempered with
E. wind. A brilliant perfect day. At daybreak
a Whippoorwill sang once uttering his note
5 times. A Blue Jay mimicking Buteo penn-
sylvanicus exactly as I was taking my bath
in the river. Broke camp after breakfast and
started down the river. Never have I seen this or
any other stream more beautiful. The air was
still and sparkling hoar frost still lay
in sheltered places, the sunlight played and
glinted through the alders and bathed the
broad pools with strong light. Many small
birds among the alders and in the spruces,
Nuthatches, Titmise, and various Warblers. Heard a
pair of Canada Jays and saw one of them. Saw
two large turtles, also two mice one of which
a Zapus hudsonicus ran nimbly across
the river skipping over the surface as if
on land although the water was deep
and clear. In B. meadows shot a Bittern
which rose as we turned a bend in the
stream. Lunched at the Forks. Thence up
Swift Cambridge to Peaslee farm walking
most of the way. Saw nothing of interest.
Down river late in P.M. a pair of Wood
Ducks passed us wide going up stream
as we neared the Forks. Low down we
flushed a Blue-winged Teal and I shot it.
Baker found three above the Great Logan ear-
lier in the day and I shot two of them. As I
paddled across to Lakeland in the evening heard
a Bubo calling.
