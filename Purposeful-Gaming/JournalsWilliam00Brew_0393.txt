Lake Umbagog, Maine
rowed up river to Whale Back Carry & walked in to the 
pond which I have never seen before. It is a beautiful
sheet of water of perhaps ten acres lying in a deep
hollow surrounded by dense forest. No Ducks in it.
Don pointed a hare near the path. It lay
crouched flat on the ground. I called off the dog
& we left it.

  On our way down river went up Bear Brook. Started
a single Hooded Merganser and shot it. No other 
Ducks seen. Water very high.

  Canada Jays were seen in several places along 
the river. They were as interesting as usual, very tame
& noisy. Their bearing is gentle and confiding at
times a little  saucy. They are not as rollicking
as Blue Jays.

  Reached camp about dark. Charley started a
Duck from the bushes in front of my tent. 
Yesterday, a very large "blue" hawk came and sat 
in the maple over the cook tent. From Charley's
description it must have been a Gos Hawk. We
saw a Brown Eagle at Moll's Carry this morning.

Oct. 10
Cloudy most of the day with occasional gleams of sunshine.
Morning still up to 10 o'clock. A high N.W. wind the rest of
the day.
  Shortly after daybreak Jim discovered a large flock 
of Coots in the Lake off B. Cove. As soon as we finished
breakfast we put the grass on my boat and started
after them. When we were well out in the Lake
a flock of nine Herring Gulls passed us. After 
searching for nearly an hour we finally make
out the Coots near the usual place off the cove. We
