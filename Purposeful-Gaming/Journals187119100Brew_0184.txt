1886
Aug. 21
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and still; Ther. 55[degrees] at sunrise, 69[degrees] at noon.
  Spent the forenoon in the Estabrook woods going
over nearly the same ground as during my last 
visit. Although the day was simply perfect I saw very
few birds - scattering Cat-birds, Towhees, Thrashers,
and Sparrows and two small mixed flocks, the first
containing about 5 Chickadees, 4 Chestnut-sided Warblers,
two Black -Throated Green Warblers, a Red-bellied Nuthatch,
a Vireo or two, and an Oven-bird.

  The other flock included several Chickadees, about
and Chestnut-sided Warblers, one or two Nashvilles, an
adult male Red start, two Creepers (Mniotilta) and several
Red-eyes.
  Jays were numerous and noisy. I also saw 
three Chipmunks and heard the first fall Hyla.
  Late in the afternoon went down river by
boat with Purdie (who came up to spend Sunday).
Saw about thirty Swallows (the majority N. horreorum,
two to them J. bicolor and five Cotile Seporia) and 
large numbers of Swifts skimming about over the 
river.

  Passing the [?] bed on the way down we started
about 100 Aegelaeus, on our return two Wood Ducks
shot past and dropped int the "rice" making a 
loud slosh as they struck the water.
  There were several Red-tailed Hawks sailing
about, all apparently young birds.
  I shot a fine ad male Oriole in full autumnal 
plumage.
  The Woodcock seen yesterday could not be
found although I beat for him carefully with Lamen.
