on shooting it found that my suspicions were
correct. I was a long time in finding it
for it caught in a hanging bunch of [?Tillandsia]
fifteen feet or more above the ground. It was
a female. 
  Shortly after this Chapman rejoined me. 
He had shot a [male] H. bachmani. While we
[?were] comparing notes a large flock of Warblers
came along keeping high up in the tops
of the cypresses. By shooting at all that
[?] show of movement and [?being] head down
at the ends of the terminal twigs we got
three more Bachman's Warblers in the course
of a few minutes sacrificing several Parulas
also. 
  Gray Squirrels were surprisingly numerous &
tame in this swamp. I must have seen a
dozen. 
  Returned to our house boat about noon. Just 
before dinner I slipped out among the [?oak]
[?scrub] on the "Bluff" & hearing a Warbler making
a [?fine], [?] [?] sound went to the spot
and [?discovered] two [male] Bachman's Warblers
chasing one another. I quickly shot both with
my auxiliary. 
  Skinning birds all the afternoon putting up
our table under a Pin oak on the bluff. At 
frequent intervals we heard the [?"gobbling"] of the 
Sand-hill Cranes in the cypress ponds nearly
a mile away. At that distance the sound
reminded me of the distant lowing of cattle.
Chapman compared it to cow-bells.
