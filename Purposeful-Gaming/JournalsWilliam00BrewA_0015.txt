Charleston, South Carolina
Clear and hot. Ther 80 [degree symbol] at noon.
  Awoke this morning as the train was 
entering Florence. From this place to Charleston
I spent much of the time looking out at
the flying landscape. Vegetation wonderfully 
advanced fully a month ahead of the average
season. Many sweet gums already in nearly full
leaf and some of the deciduous oaks covered
thinly with expanding foliage. The cypresses still
perfectly bare as were also the black jack 
scrub oaks. The woods everywhere beautiful
with wild flowers: yellow jasmine, dogwood, 
red-bud, trailing blackberries, even the cluster
roses in full bloom. Saw a few birds, Meadow
Larks, a Sparrow Hawk or two, several Flickers
and unrecognized Sparrows rising in Flocks
from the weed fields. At a station in the 
[piney?] woods where the train stopped heard
Pine Warblers & Bluebirds singing and a 
Gnatcatcher wheezing. Curiously enough we
did not see a Buzzard of either species
until just as we were entering Charleston
when three Black Vultures rose from a 
vacant lot near the station.

Two or three Song Sparrows singing vigorously
and continuously in the garden at the
