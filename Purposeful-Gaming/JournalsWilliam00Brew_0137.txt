1888
Sept. 25
Lake Umbagog, Maine
A dense fog up to 9 A. M. afterwards a radiantly
beautiful morning the air clear and spark-
ling, the sun warm, the sky cloudless, no
wind. Afternoon with strong E. wind and
gathering clouds. To Megalloway River at 7
A. M. For the first two hours we rowed
on through the dense fog. No birds, no
animal life of any kind - only the
damp chilly fog surrounding the woods
and river. At the "Horse Race" a Sharp-shinn-
ed Hawk passed and I shot him. The
sun was now visible and the woods sud-
denly awoke and teemed with life. Squirrels
barked, Warblers and Sparrows chirped, from
every side came the nasal whine of Sitta
canadensis. Landed at Bottle Brook pond
a Sitta carolinensis calling in the trees
creeping through the woods I came upon
five Ruffed Grouse. After a moment all
flew, one merely flirting up into a 
mountain maple but expecting Ducks I
did not shoot at them. Had just reached
the lower end of the pond when the
Steamer passed and whistled. Three Black
Ducks rose and flew out. Creeping along
the edge I came suddenly on a Wood Duck
She was out of range and I in full view
but I stood perfectly still and presently
she swam in and I shot her. Started a
Heron and a fine adult Eagle. Three Can-
ada Jays on the point. Pine Grosbeaks
calling in the distance. Then went
