230 CRUISE OF THE NEPTUNE 
siderable volume of evidence to show that the main direction 
of movement of erratics was northward. Thus, boulders of 
granite supposed by Prof. Haughton to be derived from North 
Somerset are found 100 miles to the northeastward, and pebbles 
of granite, identical with that of Granite point, also in North 
Somerset, occur 135 miles to the northwest. The east side of 
king-william land is also said to be strewn with boulders like 
the gneiss of Montreal island, to the southward. Prof. Haugh- 
ton shows the direction and distance of travel of some of these 
fragments by arrows on his geological map of the Arctic 
archipelago, and reverts to the same subject on pages 393-394, 
pointing out the general northward movement of ice indicated, 
and referring the carriage of the boulders to floating ice of the 
glacial period.' 
' Near Princess royal island, in Prince of Wales strait, and 
also on the coast of Prince of wales island, the copper said to 
be picked up in large masses by the Eskimos may be supposed 
to be derived from the Cambrian rocks of the Coppermine river 
region to the south, as it is not probable that it occurs in place 
anywhere in the region of horizontal limestone where it is 
found.' 
' Dr. Armstrong, previously quoted, notes the occurrence of 
granitic and other crystalline rocks, not only on the south shore 
of Baring land, but also on the hills inland. These, from what 
is known of the region, can scarcely be supposed to have come 
from elsewhere than the continental land to the southward.' 
' In an account of the scientific results of the Polaris expedi- 
tion, it is stated of the west coast of Smith sound, north of the 
Humboldt glacier, that " wherever the locality was favourable 
the land is covered by drift, sometimes containing very charac- 
teristic lithological specimens, the identification of which with 
rocks of South Greenland was a very easily accomplished task. 
For instance, garnets of unusual large size were found in lati-
