Concord, Massachusetts
three Tanagers and a Grosbeak.
  The only migrants met with, were the Canada Fly catch-
er entered above and a very small Gray-checked Thrush
which started from the roadside as I was driving home.
  The yellow-eyed grass and Potentilla Canadensis are 
non abundant in damp fields, while ladies slippers
occur everywhere in the the oak woodland . Houstonia is 
still abundant, but in most places concealed by the 
rank grass. The high-bush blueberry is snowy with 
chesters of creamy white bells: the barberry hung with
golden racemes, the huckleberry with salmon red bells.
