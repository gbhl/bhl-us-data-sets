Squirrels which were in great numbers (both chipmunks & 
reds) evidently attracted by the beech mast.

  In the clearing about the camps, an opening of
the usual character sprinkled with tall stubs and
littered with fallen logs and tops and the unusual
growth of raspberry bushes, small birds were present in
great numbers and variety.  While the guides were
gone in search of a boat I passed a very pleasant time
listening to and watching them. There were Juncos,
Peabody Birds, Nuthatches, [?] ( several P. hudsonicus)
Purple Finches, Pine Linnets, Red Crossbills and several
Woodpeckers among which were a P. articus and a
Hylotomus.  It was an animated and most interesting
gathering.

  After getting the boats the guides returned and Duncan
and I began fishing while Jim proceeded to pitch
the tent on an island and make ready for the night.

fishing at 
B.Pond,[/margin]
  The pond was perfectly calm and trout were rising
in every direction but for some time I cast in vain.
Finally we tried the expedient of paddling directly to
where a trout had risen and casting over the spot.
This proved successful in many cases especially when we
got to the spot quickly.  Fishing thus and using only the 
fly, I took, in about three hours, nine fish that would
weigh about eleven pounds, besides losing half as many more.
It was the best fly fishing I have had since 1887.
  B. Pond is perfect little gem. Perhaps half-a-mile 
in length its shore line is very picturesque and broken by deep
narrow coves. Everywhere green woods come to the waters edge.
The growth is largely arbor vitae. The water is clear as 
can be.

After dark a Barred Owl hooted at intervals for several hours.
