raged for an hour or more burning quite
across the island with a width of 100 yds or
more. We all took stations on the leeward side
but saw only four or five Rails of which I 
shot one and Dr Allen another. They rose a 
hundred yards or more ahead of the fire and
flew long distances seeming much alarmed. One, 
however, came out of the grass directly in front
of the fire. Swamp Sparrows & March Wrens also
came and I shot one of the latter, a C. stellaris
as it was flying over the water. Saw a single
Sea-side Sparrow and shot it but failed to find it.
  We next crossed the river and fired a long
narrow island on the west side. The grass was
dryer here and the fire ran madly making
a great roaring and, when it got into an extension
bed of cane, sending up flames 15 to 20 ft and 
filling the air with Black smoke through which
the sun shone dimly. The Rails were thoroughly
alarmed and began to show themselves at
frequent intervals, some flying others walking over 
the beds of [?] grass or sneaking under the 
banks. Yet they were very shy & instantly disappeared
when they saw us several turning back towards
the fire. I shot four, one sitting, three flying
losing one of the latter. Many Marsh Wrens 
(palustris) singing sotto voce on this island.
  At sunset saw hundreds of Herons (chiefly caerulea
[?] ludoviciana) assembling to roost on a [?nearby/?marshy]
treeless island near us. Night Herons (N. [?])
flying about at dusk. Paddled back by
moonlight reaching camp at 8.30. A flock of 50
White Ibis passed over us at about 8 P.M. looking
[margin] in the dim light like a band of ghosts or a wandering 
moon beam in a dark cellar. Their wings made a strong rustling sound.
