dominates and incloses lenses of hematite, while where the 
hematite is most plentiful it incloses similar lenses of jasper. 
The detailed description of these rocks shows that the 
measures of this division contain an immense amount of 
hematite. The rocks of the division do not occur on all the 
islands, being wanting on Flint, Belanger and ross. On 
Anderson they are represented by a few thin beds not rich in 
ore, while on Clarke they form the summit of the section with 
a thickness of eighty feet. They reach their maximum develop- 
ment on Gillies and Taylor, where their ores are richest and 
most concentrated. Farther northward they become thinner 
and poorer in ore, being twenty feet thick on Davieau and only 
eight feet thick on McTavish, where they die out. "No trace of 
these measures is found underlying the upper rocks on the 
islands south of the nastapoka group. 
The fourth division, consisting of red jaspilites, is an 
arbitrary one, of use only as a subdivision of the iron-bearing 
rocks. Wherever the jaspilites are well developed the richer 
beds are underlain with leaner measures, unfit for working, and 
these poorer ores constitute this division. On Clarke island 
these beds are twenty feet thick; on Gillies they vary from ten 
to twenty feet in thickness, on Taylor they are ten feet, while 
to the northward they merge into the overlying division, all 
poor in iron ores. 
The richest ores are found in division III, where extensive 
beds several feet in thickness are found containing ore practi- 
cally free from jasper, and ranging in iron values from thirty 
per cent to sixty per cent. Most of these ores, however, would 
require separation from the bands and lenses of jasper before 
becoming sufficiently rich to be economically treated in the 
furnace. The position of the ores on the islands separated from 
the mainland by a sound varying from a mile to four miles in 
width, with excellent, almost tideless, harbours, constitute ideal 
conditions for shipment. The mining of the ores would also be
