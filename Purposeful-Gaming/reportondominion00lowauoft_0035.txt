VOYAGE TO THE BAY 7 
finally sinks into the sea with the Button islands, which form a 
group extending some miles beyond the cape. The heavy tides 
of Ungava bay exhaust themselves in the passages between the 
islands, and, in doing so, cause very dangerous currents. Gray 
strait, lying between the cape and the inner islands, would form 
an excellent ship canal, if it were not for these strong currents, 
which cause a dangerous sea when the tide is running against 
the wind, especially when the wind is eastward and the Atlantic 
swell heaves into the strait. 
Port Burwell is an excellent harbour, sheltered from all 
but the southwest winds, and, even with these, distant capes 
break the force of the wind and sea. The harbour lies on the 
western side of Gray strait, and about fifteen miles from Cape 
Chidley. It was originally discovered by Commander Gordon, 
who erected one of the Observation Stations there in 1885. 
The surrounding country, although low in comparison with 
that to the southward, 'is rugged, with steep rocky cliffs, that 
rise from 100 to 500 feet above the water of the harbour. There 
is little level ground in the neighbourhood, and the trading post 
established there is situated on a small inside harbour, which 
cannot be seen from the anchorage. Trade is carried on with 
some dozen families of Eskimos living on the coast, and this is 
supplemented by the seals caught by the agent. 
This is probably the most convenient and safest place for 
the establishment of a customs station for the regulation of the 
shipping trade, entering or leaving Hudson strait, and a small 
expenditure for lights would make it a safe port of entry at all 
times. The south side of the mouth of Hudson strait, during 
the season of ice, is much less embarrassed than the northern 
side; as a rule, Port Burwell is free of ice early and late in 
the season. 
Some little trouble occurred in securing the services of Ford 
as interpreter, he being under employment at the station; but 
the matter was finally satisfactorily arranged with the agent.
