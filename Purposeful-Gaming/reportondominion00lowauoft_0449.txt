APPENDIX iv. 323 
Two specimens of corals from Beechey island are not referable to 
any genus with which the writer is acquainted. In these specimens 
the structure is revealed, by weathering at the calicular surface and 
in horizontal and longitudinal sections, as well as in sections obtained 
by rubbing down and polishing. As the writer is unable to place 
this coral, to his satisfaction, in any described genus, it is thought 
best to establish a new genus for its reception. The main generic 
characters are enumerated below with a brief description of the 
species which the writer has much pleasure in naming after Mr. 
Low. 
boreaster. Gen. nov. 
Corallum composite, massive (or thickly incrusting), made up of 
intimately connected polygonal corallites communicating with each 
other by means of mural pores. Septa in the form of longitudinal 
lamellae, twelve in number. tabulae simple. 
This genus resembles Favosites in having numerous pores in the 
walls of the corallites, but differs from it in the possession of lamellar 
septa somewhat similar to those of columnaria, nyctopora and 
Lyopora. From these three genera, however, Boreaster differs in 
having 12 septa only, of two alternating sizes, to a corallite. Column- 
aria and Lyopora are without mural pores. nyctopora was described 
by Nicholson as having pores, but in well preserved specimens from 
the type locality, examined by the writer, mural pores were not seen; 
it possesses 16 septa of two orders. Boreaster and calapoecia resemble 
each other in both having pores, but in the latter genus the corallites 
are not intimately united under any circumstances, and the septa 
are in the form of spine-bearing ridges. 
This interesting coral may be conveniently grouped with the 
favositidoe, as its generic affinities appear to place it close to Cala- 
poecia. 
Boreaster lowi. Sp. nov. 
Corallum growing in irregularly shaped masses with an unevenly 
undulating surface; composed of small, polygonal corallites so closely 
united that all trace of the line of contact between contiguous walls 
is apparently lost. Corallites opening at right angles to the surface, 
averaging about 75 mm. in diameter and generally five or six sided, 
as seen in transverse section, the sides of the polygons being distinctly
