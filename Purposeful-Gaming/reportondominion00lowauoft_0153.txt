HISTORICAL SUMMARY 81 
sufficient money to outfit a small vessel, under the command of 
Zachariah Gillam, a New England captain, who, accompanied 
by Groseilliers and radisson, sailed through Hudson strait and 
down the bay to the mouth of Rupert river. Here friendly 
intercourse was held with the natives, and a small fort was 
built, in which the party successfully wintered. 
on the return of Gillam, in 1669, Prince Rupert and his 
associates applied to Charles II. for a charter. This was granted 
on the 2nd of May, 1670, to the Governor and Company of 
Adventurers trading from England to Hudson bay. It states 
that ' in consideration of their having at their own cost and 
charges undertaken an expedition to Hudson bay in the north- 
east parts of America, for the discovery of a new passage to the 
South sea, and for the finding of some trade for furs, minerals 
and other considerable commodities, and of their already having 
made by such their undertakings such discoveries as did en- 
courage them to proceed farther in pursuance of the said design, 
by means whereof there might probably arise great advantage 
to the King and his Kingdom, absolutely ceded and gave up to 
the said undertakers, the Whole trade and commerce of all those 
creeks, seas, straits, bays, rivers, lakes and sounds, in what lati- 
tude soever they may be, which are situated within the entrance 
of the Hudson's straits, together with all the countries, lands 
and territories upon the coasts and confines of the said seas, &c., 
that they alone should have the right of trading thither, and 
whoever should infringe this right, and be found selling or buy- 
 within the said boundaries, should be arrested and all his 
 their merchandises should become forfeit and confiscated, 
c that one-half thereof should belong to the King and the other 
half to the Hudson's Bay Company.' 
In 1670 the newly formed company sent out Charles Bayly, 
as Governor, to establish Fort Rupert at the mouth of Rupert 
river, in latitude 51 30', thus establishing their sovereignty by 
right of the first permanent habitation of the territory granted
