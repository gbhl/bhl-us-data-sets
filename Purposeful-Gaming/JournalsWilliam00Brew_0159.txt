Oct. 7.   
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Cloudy; wind N.W. light;  pouring rain all
day. At daybreak Lumen discovered four
Sea Coots in the Lake off the B. Brook shore.
We started for them about 7 with a care-
fully grassed boat. They proved to be White-
winged Coots. all old [male] [male] and so shy
that we could not get within 200 yds.
Later in the day a flock of at least
thirty Coots was seen in the same place
They looked like Butter-bills through the 
glass. Crossing the lake we saw three
white-bellied swallows. Returning we 
started for the meadows at the Outlet
It was raining like a thunder shower so
we left "Don" at camp, a most unwise step
as the sequel proved. We had crossed 
the marsh and were paddling down
the river where I saw three Ducks just
over the bank. They swam off as we approached
and when the boat grounded and I had to 
shoot were fully 50 yds off. I fired only one 
barrel and stopped [?] : both at once
made for the grass and although we 
searched long for them we lost both
One started from a bunch of grass near
us but at once down and was not 
seen again. I think these Ducks were
the same three seen yesterday. They were
either Greater Scaups or Ring-necks. I am 
doubtful which.While looking for them
we heard a winter Yellow-leg whistle I 
called him down and shot at him break-
