on the half mile or so of sand that I travelled but I
searched in vain for their eggs or young.
  Saw a Gull, which I identified satisfactorily by my glass
as an immature Ring-bill, flying along the Beach.
A few Mison's Terns were also flying about & our pair
acted as if nesting. Spotted Sandpipers [?].
After returning to town I called on Mr. David Fisher, a
veteran resident [?], & got some valuable information
about the [?] & other birds of the island.
