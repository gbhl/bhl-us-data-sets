148 cruise OF THE NEPTUNE 
line cut from the skin of the Big seal (Phoca barbata), and 
varies in length from ten to thirty feet. The traces are regu- 
lated in length, so that the dogs when pulling straight ahead have 
the leading dog about two yards in advance, and the others in 
pairs about a yard behind each other. The traces are made long 
in order that the dogs may not be massed in passing rough or 
thin ice, and for the same reason the traces are not fastened to 
the front of the sled, but to a loop of walrus line which is at- 
tached at the first bar, or nearly a third of the length back. By 
this means the sled is easily turned, and allowed to run at a 
considerable angle to the direction in which the dogs are travel- 
ling; advantage is thus taken of the smoothest places when 
journeying along the broken ice piled upon the shores. The use 
of individual traces is not without its drawbacks. While 
travelling the dogs constantly cross from side to side among 
themselves, and weave their traces into a single rope. Stops 
must be made every few hours to untangle the traces. The long- 
trace is also constantly fouling hummocks while passing over 
rough ice; when this occurs the dog is pulled back to the sled by 
the fouled trace, and if he does not get hurt physically, at least 
his pride is offended, so that, when freed, he usually has a little 
unpleasantness with every dog he passes to regain his place in 
the team. The leading dog answers more or less satisfactorily 
to the word of command, and is followed by the other dogs. 
The usual commands are to swing right or left, to start and to 
stop. The dogs are very acute of hearing, and the words are 
usually given in a low tone. When a dog is to receive punish- 
ment he is pulled back in the team and his shortened trace made 
fast to the sled; the driver can then give his undivided attention 
to the whip. A great deal of dexterity is shown in using the 
whip, and a lot of time is spent practising with it. A good whip 
handler knows at least four or five different cuts, and can hit 
within an inch or so anywhere inside the length of the long lash. 
The blow is terrific.
