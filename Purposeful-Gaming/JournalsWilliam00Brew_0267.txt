hour high. I also saw a [male] Sphyrapicus varius. Hooded
Warblers were numerous along the river. A large flock
of Florida Grackles was singing in medley in a cypress
over the stream.
  Throughout these woods dogwood, redbuds, buck eye and
the "snowdrop tree" (Helesia diptera) were abundant and in full bloom.
There was also a shrub which I took to be a Spiraea which
bore cymes of snow white flowers. The oaks, sweet gums,
beeches and red maples were in about half leaf; the
cypresses just veiled with tender green opening foliage.
  Finally Hartsfield returned and we started back to
town. Crossing the plantation we started several large
flocks of Meadow Larks and Grass Finches but heard
none of either species sing. Along the main road we
found Carolina Doves , numerous in flocks and I shot
three, one flying. In a pond which we passed several
Carolina Grebes were calling. The country is similar
to that about Tallahassee but less rolling, the soil
more loamy or sandy with little clay. The roads
are hard and smooth. The woods are even more
beautiful than those near Tallahassee  having more
variety and more flowering shrubs (the red bud is
wanting near Tallahassee and the "snow-drop bush (Halesia diptera)
ran while I have not seen the Spiraea there. Pinus
predominate over hardwoods on the higher ground.
Pinus australis is common and I saw much Pinus
mitis. Pinus Taeda is perhaps the most common pine.
In the Chippola swamp the mud was everywhere
tracked over with opussum foot prints. Hartsfield
also saw an old track of a Turkey. Buzzards
of both species were seen in small numbers.
