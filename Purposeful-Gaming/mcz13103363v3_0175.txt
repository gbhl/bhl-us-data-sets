day but quite cold.
Ther. about 20 [degrees]���30 [degrees]���

and walked down to
school alone. When I

had some lunch and
took a ride with father
through Belmont and
down by Fresh pond
which was entirely covered
with ice with the exception
of a few air holes. When
I got back found R. Deane

with him for some time.
In the evening rode into
Boston in the Carryall with
father & mother and heard
Dickens read Nich. B. Nickelby &
Roots at Hollytree Inn.
