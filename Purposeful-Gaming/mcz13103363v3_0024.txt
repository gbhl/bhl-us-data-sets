1867
Tuesday, February 5.
  Cloudy all day. Ther. from
36 [degrees] to 40 [degrees] during the day.
The walking was worse than
I have ever seen it before.
Got late to school. Let the
chickadee caught yesterday go
but afterwards found him dead
under the tree. Found a chickadee
in the trap when I got
home but let him go.
Went shooting in P.M. with
R. Deane in P.M. Saw five
meadow larks & we both fired
at one flying but missed
him. Got home at 6 P.M.
Studied about an hour. Read
'Pickwick Papers' the rest of
the evening. The ground is now
bare in many places.
1867
Wednesday, February.
  Clear and pleasant. Ther. at
8 A.M. 30 [degrees], at 3 P.M. 40 [degrees], at 10 P.M.
34 [degrees]. Snowballed most of the
way home from school. In
P.M. went up to the Nichols'.
In the evening studied about
an hour, read 'Pickwick Papers'
and copied a good deal from
my diary of 1866 into my book of
Birds. Went to bed at 10 P.M.
Ordered a blow gun to be made
at Mr. Withey's. The crust
bore this moring. The sleighing
is miserable.
