alarm & as the Ibises started, each springing like
a Black Duck, the air seemed filled with
white birds. There were fully forty Ibises, about
one third of them young (gray) birds. They
came out past us within perhaps 70 yds.
then turned & came back high overhead.
We fired six or eight shots at them & I
dropped one, an adult in too ragged plumage
to be worth skinning.
  The dogs trailed some turkeys across this
prairie but failed to find them.
  On the way back to Ostend "Nelly" found
& pointed a small bevy of Quail by the
roadside. I shot one as they rose and
following them across the railroad into some
low scrub killed four more. C[ory] sat in

  After passing Ostend we flushed two bevies
of Quail. Of the first I killed one; of the        
second I one & C. one. I also killed two
fine Florida Grackles.
