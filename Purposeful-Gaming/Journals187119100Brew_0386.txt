1887    
Oct. 17
Great Island, Hyannis, Mass.
Clear and very warm with light S.W. wind.
  Off on the sound for the forenoon in a larger
cat-boat with Messrs. Cory & Chamberlain. The breeze
was very light at first but freshened as the day wore 
on. We passed Hyannis and stood over nearly
to Centreville. Saw perhaps one hundred Scoters,
mostly Pelionetta with a sprinkling of Oedenicia and
Melanetta. They were shy as a rule but we bagged
three, two young Surf Scoters and an adult [male] Melanetta,
besides two Horned Grubes. Every gun in the
party was fired at each of these birds, I believe.
We shot down several others that we failed to 
bag, Saw two or three Loons and a single
Cormorant. It was so warm on the water that
the sail was a most delightful one.
  Returned in time for lunch immediately
after which we started for Boston. Saw nothing
of interest during the drive to Hyannis except
a flock of about fifty Black Ducks which
rose from the creek as we passed.
