laid across the continent to aid in the rapid transport of this 
wealth to the seaboard. If the increase in the area of land 
opened annually to cultivation continues as at present, a few 
years will show such a volume of grain to be transported that 
the new outlets will be unable to give free exit to it, and a new 
lane by which it can be taken to the European markets must be 
found. 
The route by rail to the port of Churchill, on the western side 
of Hudson bay, and from thence to Europe in ships, is the 
shortest, and is likely to prove the best, of all those outside the 
present routes by rail to the headwaters of the St. Lawrence 
navigation. 
Ships go wherever cargoes can be obtained, and all that is

is a line of rails to carry freight to one of its ports. At present 
the Hudson's Bay Company and the revillon Fur Company

As stated in the historical summary, the London merchants

in the White sea in the days of Queen Elizabeth. Spurred on 
by the success attending this adventure to the northeast, a few 
years later they sent vessels to the northwest, in the hopes of 
opening up a similar trade, and of discovering a short and safe 
passage to the rich markets of China and India. 
Hudson's voyage in 1610 resulted in the discovery of Hud- 
son bay, and in the knowledge that no great opportunities existed 
there for extensive commerce, owing to the lack of civilized 
natives. James and fox completed the exploration of the bay, 
without coming in contact with any of the natives residing on 
its shores. 
The formation of the Hudson's Bay Company was due to the 
knowledge of the French fur traders, that a profitable trade
