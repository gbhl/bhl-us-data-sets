1888.
Sept. 13
Early morning clear, afterwards clouds and light
showers. To C. Pond starting at 7 A.M. Just above
the Sluice a Hooded Mer. started from a pocket
in the bank. I shot it and this was the
only shot fired before reaching the pond. The
water was high and our progress rapid and
easy compared to last year. Saw nothing but
common small birds. On reaching the pond
discovered two Wood Ducks near the outlet feeding
among the lily pads. They finally saw us and
flew dropping into a cove. I tried to stalk
them there but failed and they flew back
towards the outlet. We then landed and
lunched in a wood path. A flock of four or
five Parus hudsonicus with a Certhia about us.
After lunch paddled around the pond. Saw a
Solitary Sandpiper and a mixed flock of Warblers.
Returning to outlet spied three Wood Ducks, all old
drakes. Paddled up to them under cover of tall
bullrushes I shot one on water and missed
another as it rose. The third did not fly at
all but swam up to the dead bird itself
fell a victim to its folly. The two young Ducks
rose at the shots from somewhere behind and
flew down river. We started them once on our
return. About a mile above Sluice flushed a
Black Duck which I fired a snap shot at
just as it was going around a bend. A cloud
of feathers came back but the Duck although
barely able to fly kept on up the river un-
til lost from sight.
