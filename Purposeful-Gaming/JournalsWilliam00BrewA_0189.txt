Martha's Vineyard. I came to Edgartown last night and this
morning started for Muskegat with Capt. Fred. Pease in a large
cat-boat. The wind was strong from the S.W.[south west] when we set sail
and there was some fog which thickened and shut down
after we left Cape Pogue. We saw one distance out but
failed to hit Muskegat. As we advanced the water deepened
and we got into an ugly swell which threatened to
swamp the boat. Pease concluded that we had passed to
the S. of Muskegat and were running out to sea so we turned
about and started back. After about an hour the fog lifted
& we made Cape Pogue much to our relief. It turned out
that we had run inside instead of outside of Muskegat. Had
we trusted to the Terns we should have found the island
easily as they were flying continually past us in what in what 
proved to be its true direction when we were nearest to it.
We had a hard beat home reaching town about 6 P.M.
Saw no Petrels & nothing, in fact, except Terns. Caught a
blue fish.
