Warblers and Least Flycatcher singing. Cedar Birds here and elsewhere
in pairs and small flocks. Several Red-eyes, Grackles and
a pair of Orioles. Also a pair of Pine Warblers feeding
chattering young which I did not see but which doubtless
were out of the nest. Altogether the hogs back ridge and
swamp behind it contains as many breeding birds this
season as any spot I have visited.
  Crossing the railroad I walked slowly through
the open woods to the N.W. Nothing here but a Wood
Pewee or two. On reaching the swampy hollow, however,
I found a Wilson's Thrush in full song.
  The pair of Indigo Birds near the trap-shooters shanty
were in the same thicket when I left them on the 29th.
Both were chirping angrily at a cat which I started
from the bushes. As soon as this source of alarm was
gone the female Indigo went almost directly to her nest in
a small bushy black oak sapling where I found her sitting
on one egg.
  While searching the thickets along the brook I discovered
a Black-billed Cuckoo brooding their young in a nest closely
hidden in a shad bush copse. The old bird actually flew at
my head as I put up my hand to the nest, passing
within a few inches of my face & snapping his bill angrily.
  In the fields just above Frazer's, on the Adam's place,
a Meadow Lark and Bobolink were singing. As I
was waiting for the horse car I found a Warbling Vireo's
nest in a linden at least 40 ft above the street, The
[male] was singing on the nest.
  In the woods on the east side of the trap-shooters' field
a Crow followed me about cawing angrily & incessantly
& after alighting in the tree tops within 20 yds. of me.
She must have had young somewhere near.
