1888
Sept. 4
Lake Umbagog, Maine
Clear and warm with high S. wind.    
  At 8 a.m. started off in the buckboard for Upton
Hill. A dense fog, obscured everything but the sun
could be seen dimly through it and before I reached
the post office it came out clear and warm. In
the deep hollow I passed a mixed flock of Warblers
and Litinia among them, were some Kinglets (R. Satrapa)
one of which sang several times, along the fences
were a few Sparrows. The asters are superb this
season. The road was lined with dense beds
of them and about their showy white and
purple clusters butterflies of several species fluttered
by scores.

descended to the run behind Morse's. As I neared

fly and shot one of them as well as the

was a large mixed flock of warblers in the                          
alders & with them a brood of Indigo Birds.

  In the alders on the hillside above Don found                   
& pointed two Woodcock. The first rose strong          
& whistled, the second fluttered out feebly,
like a young Grouse. I fired at both but missed
having very poor chances both times.

  Recrossing the road I next beat the pasture
north of Frosts flushing three Woodcock of
which I killed two. Don worked finely &
got steady points on all three birds. Two were
