VOYAGE To THE BAY 15 
decreased, so that, finally, the animals could hardly remain 
below the surface. The launch was forced among the tumbling 
mass of frightened creatures, and when directly over them, a 
man in the bow would select a large one, and drive a harpoon 
into it. The head of the harpoon was fastened by a few fathoms 
of line to an empty water keg, and as soon as the harpoon was 
fast the keg was thrown overboard. This harpooning is neces- 
sary, as the animals sink as soon as they are killed, and the 
buoyancy of the keg is required to keep them from being lost. 
When one had been harpooned, the launch was stopped, and 
the rest of the band continued to flee. Now comes the dan- 
gerous moment of the chase. The wounded walrus rises to the 
surface, and immediately attacks the launch, which it endea- 
vours to capsize by fixing its tusk over the side. Quick shooting 
is the order, and even with a storm of bullets, many a monster 
has to be rapped over the head or pushed away with guns and 
spears. After this experience with the few first killed, it was 
found that by keeping the propeller in motion and the whistle 
blowing, they would not attack the launch, but would waste 
their energies in an endeavour to destroy the keg; consequently 
the danger of the sport was considerably lessened. Upwards of 
half a dozen shots, at close range, were necessary to kill each 
walrus. As soon as one was dispatched, it was towed to the 
ship, or to a convenient cove at the shore. Seven were captured 
during the day, and hoisted on board, where they completely 
filled the after deck. Owing to the difficulty of securing these 
large animals, at least twice that number, fatally wounded, 
were lost; we later found this to be the usual proportion of 
killed to captured, where these animals are hunted for their 
skins and blubber, a waste of life altogether too great 
That evening the ship was headed for Cape Wolstenholme, 
and early next morning came to anchor in Erik cove, close to 
that headland. Advantage was taken of a fine convenient 
stream of fresh water to fill the nearly empty tanks. During
