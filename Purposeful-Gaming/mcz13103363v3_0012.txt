1867
Saturday, January 12.
  Clear. At 6 A.M. ther. at 10 [degrees],
at 9 P.M. 10 [degrees]. Went shooting
in A.M. as usual starting
at 6. Followed the track of a
flock of quails for some distance
and came to the place where
they flew. Saw a blue jay. To my
great surprise, a male goldfinch
in the full summer plumage
flew over me. They were scraping
a part of Fresh pond. Got home at
9.30 A.M. and stuffed one of the
snow buntings shot yesterday,
finishing him at 3 P.M. Went up
to R[uth] Deane's & found him cleaning his
gun. Rode up to Mt. Auburn on a
pung & found my squirrel trap sprung
with nothing in it. In the evening
stuffed the other snow bunting.
Sunday, January 13, 1867.
  Cloudy all day. In the latter
part of P.M. it spit  snow.
Went to church and Sabbath
school in A.M. and was
almost late to the former.
Mr. Parker preached. Read
'Homes without Hands' most
of P.M. At 4 P.M. took a
walk up Mt. Auburn St.
and looked over the fence
at my squirrel trap but
it was not sprung. Saw a
red poll. Read 'Homes without
Hands' all the evening and
went to bed at 8.45.
