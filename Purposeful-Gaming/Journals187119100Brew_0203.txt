cloudless blue. There was almost no wind
and in the woods the rustling of leaves,
the fall of acorns, the chirping of birds and 
the chuckling of  squirrels, all 20 characteristic of
early autumn, were distinctly audible at
considerable distances.
  The leaves are turning fast, especially
those of the gray birches. Within the past
week, or at the most, two weeks, summer has
gone and early autumn taken its place.
The transition is ever shorter and better
marked than that from Spring to Summer.
The foliage is getting worn and thin, the
leaves and fruits ripening. I am startled
that the change has come so soon.
  Last night I heard only one Warbler
chirp, an interesting fact considering their 
abundance in the woods to-day. To-night
they are migrating in forced and hardly
a winter passes but I hear one or 
more outside. I think the night when
heavy flights are heard passing succeed,
rather than precede, days of exceptional
abundance; or in other words, that we 
hear the birds leaving us and do not hear
them arriving. The case might be reversed
in we were to keep watch during the
early morning hours (before daylight).

  A screech Owl worked an early this
morning and another was walking this
evening in the twilight.
  A yellow-throat Vireo in full song these last three mornings.
It is the only species singing now.
