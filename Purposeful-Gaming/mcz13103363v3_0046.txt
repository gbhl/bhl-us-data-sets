Thursday, March 21, 1867.
  Two pine grosbeaks were seen by Dan at Waltham.
Cloudy all day. Ther. about
30[degrees] - 42[degrees] - 32[degrees]. The snow
melted a good deal to-day
although the wind was East
and the air chilly. Snowballed
nearly all the way from school.
In the P.M. cut out the
bottoms of about twenty
five stands and finished
about six. Found a young
pigeon dead under the
ledge. In the P.M. Leander
and Jhonty Brewster came
out and took dinner
with us: they played croquet for
some time after dinner and
then went into Boston. In the
evening went up to the Russell's.
Friday, March 22, 1867.
  Cloudy all day. Very windy
in the P.M. Spit snow a little.
Ther. 34[degrees] - 38[degrees] - 36[degrees].
The snow scarcely softened.
Snowball most of the way
home from school. Recited
my first lesson in Grecian
history to-day. In the P.M.
went shooting up to 'the
pond' with R. Deane and
we saw six or seven gulls
but did not get a shot
at any. Saw a song sparrow
and saw for the first time that
the boat house had been pulled
down. Got home at 5.30 P.M.
In the evening read a little
and played a game of croquet with
father.
