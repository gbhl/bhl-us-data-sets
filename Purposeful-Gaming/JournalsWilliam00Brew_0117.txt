1888
Sept. 14.
Cloudy all day, clearing at sunset; wind N.W.
very strong. Early in the morning the guide
saw six Black Ducks pass the camp flying
up river and lowering so decidedly above
the Sluice that we felt sure of finding them
within a mile or so. After breakfast Lumen
paddled me up at least two miles but we
saw nothing. Landed on S. bank and hunted
some spruce knolls for Grouse. "Don" pointed a
single bird which flew from a tree over my
head. I fired a snap shot and missed. Follow-
ing it "Don" again made a steady point
among some young larches I saw a Grouse in
one of them and shot its head off. About a
dozen others rose at the report, three alighting,
all of which I shot almost without moving.
Bear signs amazingly numerous among the
blueberry patches. In a small thicket of
spruce and larch we found 25 of their piles
of dung within a radius of ten yards.
Lumen says they always have special
places to which they resort for this purpose.
From the different sizes of the rolls of dung
it was evident that several bears at least
had made them. Returned to camp to
dinner. Late in P.M. I saw 5 Black Ducks
go up river and apparently lower their
flight to alight. We again paddled up after
them but found nothing. Saw a Rusty Black-
bird.
