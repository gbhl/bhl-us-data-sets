Sept.28  
MAINE, (L. Umbagog.)
Clear and rather warm; nearly dead calm all day
  Started for B. Pond this morning with Duncan and 
Jim Burnier as guides. We took the steamer to Sunday
Cove, the buckboard to the Oxford Club camp and
walked in from Rapid River a distance of a mile and a
half.

  Umbagog was swarming with Ducks this morning.
Off the south end of Great Island we passed a bunch
of about a dozen Scoters, just before reaching the
Outlet another flock of perhaps one hundred, and
off Sunday Cove a third flock of perhaps seventy or
eighty.   As nearly as I could make out all were
Dedunia americana. They were very shy or restless rising
several gunshots ahead of the boat and taking long flights
but always pitching down again into the Lake.
We also saw several flocks of Sheldrake and an
unusual number of  Loons.  Late in the afternoon while
fishing on B.Pond we heard short continuous firing
on Umbagog and afterwards learned that it was
on the lower stretch of water near Lakeside where a
boat was seen pursuing the Scoters for several hours.

  To return to our personal adventures! The tramp
across the carry to the pond was very pleasant but
without incidents of mark. The path rises for about
half-a-mile and after passing over a high ridge
timbered with fine old yellow birches and beeches [?]
perhaps an equal distance to this final stretch of
level ground bordering the pond. The last half mile
is through mixed woods badly mutilated by recent
lumbering. There are two camps and a fire-scared
clearing on the shore of the pond.

  On the high ground I saw almost nothing besides
