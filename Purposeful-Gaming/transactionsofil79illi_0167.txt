a negligible factor. 
Under this method I have had the gratifying experience of 
having a patient operated upon for appendicitis, removed 
from the operating table to a wheel chair and permitted to 
dress and walk about the hospital within six hours after the 
operation. 
When through ether it was found possible to make surgical 
operations painless and when through asepsis it was found 
that infection could be avoided, we had a comfortable feeling 
that we had solved the great problems of surgical procedure 
and that there were few, if any, great cardinal principles yet 
to be discovered. 
This recent discovery of the element of shock in surgical 
operations leads us to believe that there is still much to be dis- 
covered and that perhaps there yet remains unknown some 
great factor in surgical development quite as important as 
anaesthesia or asepsis. Certainly the prevention of shock may 
be placed on a par with these two great epoch making dis- 
coveries.
