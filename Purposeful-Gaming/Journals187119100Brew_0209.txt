by and a little suspicious "screeping" called him
directly to me where I shot him.
  A little later eight Night Hawks appeared and 
spent half-an-hour or more raiding among
the insects over the river.
  Besides them there were Long Sparrows chirping
along the banks, Swamp Sparrows in the Ledge,
and an occasional Warbler lisping within
willows or maples. Not a single bird sang.
No were  there any Bobolinks chinking over the
meadows. I saw two Barn Swallows, however,
and three King birds, besides a single Blackbird
which looked like a Motothius and which went
to roost alone in the Lusania.  Where are the 
hordes of then birds that resorted there last
month?
  There were a few Carolina Rails in the Lusania
but all were invisible as usual.
  As I came up river in the moonlight after
twilight had deepened into night an Upland
Plover passed overhead calling at regular intervals.
Its silvery whistle is one of the sweetest sounds
in nature and decidedly the most musical of 
all Nadus' notes.
  An unusually heavy flight of Warblers this evening 
beginning at twilight and lasting at least until
I went to bed (11 P.M). During this time there was
literally not a minute where one or more birds
could not be heard.  The evening was still, clear,
(with a half moon) and very sultry.

  For the past four or five nights Warblers have 
been passing in small numbers. No Thrushes lately
