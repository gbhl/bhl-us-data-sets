vertebra is a thoracic one is assumed from the fact that there 
are the normal number of lumbars and cervicals, all typical of 
their region in appearance, and all free from ribs, while between 
these regions lie thirteen vertebrae, all of which bear ribs. 
All the thirteen ribs (figs. 5 and 6) are well marked, though the 
first and the last are very short. It is unlikely that the rib at 
the upper end is cervical, or the lower one lumbar in origin in 
view of the fact that these regions have their full number of 
vertebrae without ribs. 
The cause of the scoliosis mentioned previously is shown in 
the radiograph. The body of the third thoracic vertebra (fig. 
6) is imperfect on the left of the mid-line. It shows ossification 
but is only half the size of the right half, and this center of 
ossification has remained separate from its fellow on the right 
side. The fourth body is slightly tilted up on the left to make 
up for the deficiency. The seventh thoracic vertebra on the 
left side of its body again exhibits the same deformity, with 
lack of fusion of the two centers of ossification in the body, and 
in this case the eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh vertebrae, 
lying below it, are all tilted up to compensate for the deformity. 
Both defective vertebrae show good neural arches with well 
developed ribs articulating with them. 
The only points in regard to the skeleton, which are not 
brought out by the radiographs, but become evident on dissec- 
tion, are that eight costal cartilages articulate with the ster- 
num, and that there are only two carpal bones. The carpal 
bones are not yet ossified, and so do not show in the radio- 
graphs. The proximal one is long and cylindrical, with a con- 
vex head proximally articulating with the lower end of the 
radius, and a concave facet distally for the other carpal. The 
second carpal is an irregular wedge, broad dorsally, narrow ven- 
trally, with a proximal convex articulation for the other carpal, 
and a concavoconvex facet distally for the metacarpal. It is 
impossible to identify either of these bones with any one of the 
normal carpal bones, but they resemble the navicular and lesser 
multangular more closely than any others.
