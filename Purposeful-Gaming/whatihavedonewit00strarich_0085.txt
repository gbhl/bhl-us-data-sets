THE BARN OWL 
was sufficiently strong to take her picture in the morning? She 
was feeding her young, and they would be very hungry, but not 
particularly hurt by a little longer fast than usual, and no doubt 
they would cry for food and keep her near. When she found she 
could not reach them she would perch close, and then, if they 
would cry, there was every probability that she would fly to them, 
even in a fairly strong light. 
That day my lenses were polished like diamonds, a fresh me- 
dium plate placed in the camera, the shutter set at a bulb exposure

Mother Owl left that night, we discussed giving her until mid-

and if they did not, it was almost sure their mother would not try 
to fly by day. 
A board was nailed securely over the opening. Mother Owl 
returned and attacked it beak and claw. Soon her mate came, 
and how the two of them worked! It was almost too bad. I

living up to my pact. It was not treating that mother as I would 
be treated. I whispered to the guide to go and take away the 
board. It is a good thing that he was made of a little sterner 
stuff, for he pointed out that the young were well grown, that 
there was nothing happening to injure them permanently, that 
they were birds of prey, and that if they didn't want their pic- 
tures taken they had no business to carry about such faces to 
tempt us. 
At times they would leave. Then they would return, some- 
times together, sometimes singly, and work to get the board away. 
The night was clear and cool and filled with sounds. The guide 
repeatedly assured me that there were no snakes, and I had seen
