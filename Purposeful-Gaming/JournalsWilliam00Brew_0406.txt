1889
Oct. 23   
Cloudless with strong N.W.wind. It snowed a little last night
and afterwards cleared off any cold. The meadows and edges
of the river and Lake were frozen and thin ice as well as snow
lasted all day even in places partly exposed to the sun. In
short it has been by far the coldest day we have yet had.
  After watching the three Canada Jays that we have baited
at our camp & taking several photographs of them I started
off with Jim at about 8 a.m. We rowed to the outlet
and paddled down river. We had only gone a short distance
when we saw a Duck descend on set wings & alight in
the middle of the river. It was about 40 yds. ahead & I 
shot it. It proved to be a young Surf Scoter.

  Saw three Ducks enter the outlet of Leonard's Pond &
landing I tried to stalk them. Could not find them but
discovered a superb adult [male] Gooseander diving near the
opposite those of the island. Returned to the boat & tried
to paddle across to the island but a number of ducks
rose and went out. Six Hooded Mergansers came back past
us but I wanted the Gooseander & did not shoot. He stayed
in the water but a few moments later was gone. Tried to
paddle to two young Sheldrakes asleep on a mud bank but they
awoke and flew. Saw some ducks alight below & tried another
stalk. Crossed the island & found my birds, six Hooded
Mergansers, three of them adult males in full plumage.
It was sometime before I recognized them for they kept their
crests closed. They followed the opposite shore diving incessantly.
I watched them over one hour but they would not cross to
my side. Saw an adult [male] Bufflehead flying over the pond.

  Next went to Great Meadow; nothing there. Thence to
Curtis Meadow. 24 Black Ducks feeding in the usual place at
the bend. Went off wild. A Hooded Merganser at the Outlet
Thence to Mile Meadow . Near the upper end shot a fine large
Fox. He was trotting leisurely along the edge of the woods.
