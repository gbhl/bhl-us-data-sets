1889
(June 5)
burned tract cat-tail flags sprang up the next year
and have since flourished to the practical exclusion of all
other vegetation. In these cat tails, near Alewife Brook,
I heard a note quite new to me. It was very loud
and resembled, somewhat, the outcry of the Clapper Rail
but lacked its harsh quality and vibrating undertone. I
should render it as: kuk - kuk - kuk - kuk - kuk - kuk.
given in a descending scale and rather slowly at the end.
  We waded through the middle of this place although
the water was nearly waist deep and the flags so dense
that it was impossible to be more than a yard or two
ahead. The muskrats had nests there with a space of clear
water about each and numerous run ways through the flags.
The only birds I could find were a few Red-wings.
  In the long row of willows that crosses this meadow
Denton shot a pair of Black-billed Cuckoos and in
a vegetable patch, flooded by the recent rains, a Solitary
Sandpiper which was unable to fly, its wing having
been broken and healed in such a twisted shape that it
was useless.
  A little colony of Long-billed Marsh Wrens were settled
in nearly their old ground near Beech Island (or rather
where it once stood). I started at least six different birds
but heard only one [male] singing.
  I saw a high Green Heron. Many Swamp Sparrows &
Yellow Warblers singing. A Wilson's Thrush in a thicket where
the ground was wholly submerged. A King-bird or two
as we passed.
  Reached home at 5 p.m. walking all the way back.
Had a very disagreeable but nevertheless interesting tramp.
Saw no swallows & heard no Virginia Rails.
