1888
Nov. 28
Grantville (Wellesley Hills), Mass.
Clear and for the season mild with soft S. W. wind.
  To Grantville, alone, by 10.59 train returning by 5.10
P. M. train.
  Spent the day hunting Grouse going over nearly the
same ground covered during my last visit with the
addition of a large tract of open chestnut woods
which I have not previously explored.

  In the first cover started a Grouse among thick
young oaks and fired a fruitless snap shot at him.
At the western extremity of the same woods "Don" put
him up again, running in on him. I was out of

the tops of the birches. Crossing a wide field he
disappeared in some chestnut woods beyond. Following
on we found him again the dog pointing him
this time. I had a fairly open but rather long
cross shot and missed.
  On the edge of a run beyond I put up two
fresh birds. Both rose rather wild and my shots
at both proved misses. Following up these bird "Don"
found one among some oak scrub and I killed
it over a staunch point. The other I flushed from
a fallen beech top but failed to get a shot at it.
It went only about 200 yds. and "Don" flushed it
among some upturned stumps. I had an open
but long cross shot and missed. The bird crossed
a wide stretch of mowing fields and I failed
to find it again in the woods beyond.
  During the remainder of the day I tramped
steadily through various kinds of corn but with
such poor success that I did not see another
