Friday, March 5, 1869.
  Clear but excessively cold.
Ther. about 3[degrees] - 
20[degrees] - 6[degrees]. Rose as
usual and walked
down with the fellows.
Got dismissed at
recess. In the P.M.
went down to the
Upper Port & rode
half-an-hour at Stalfard's
Velociped Rink & ten
minutes at Stiles.
At the former place
while trying to start my
machine, I broke the
bar connecting the forward
and hind wheels. In the
evening made a call at the
Dana's carry down Henrietta's
bird, and thence up to the
Deane's where I spent the
evening with Ruth.
Saturday, March 6, 1869.
  Cloudy & snowed a good
deal about an inch
falling in all. Ther. about
4[degrees] below z. - 36[degrees] - 24[degrees].
Rose as usual but as
I had a very bad cold
with a sore throat I
staid in the house all
day occupying my time
for the most part in
writing letters, reading
&c.
  In the evening
Theo came in and
studied & just as he was
about to leave R. Deane
dropped in; they both
staid little past 10 P.M.
The snow in the fields
is about three inches
deep but the roads &
sidewalks are for the
most part bare.
