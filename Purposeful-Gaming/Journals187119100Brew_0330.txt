1887                                                     
July 15  
Concord, Massachusetts.
Clear and cool with light N.W. wind.
  Off all day in the canoe starting at 10 A.M. and
sailing (most of the way) to Pantry Brook. Upon reaching
the month of this book I landed at once and lunched
in a firm piece of oak & maple woods near by. Here
I found Cornus circinata and Vibernum acerifolium. As I
was lying in a wood path a Wilson's Thrush discovered me
and began to whistle anxiously. Presently a [male] Grosbeak 
and Tanager and a pair of Red-eyes appeared, each
chirping about me for sometime before leaving. All
probably had young.
  Just before landing here I shot two Bobolinks from
my canoe. One was an ad.[male] changing pl. the other a
young bird also changing. They formed part of a
flock of nearly fifty containing only two old [male]s.
  After lunch I started up the meadow on the south
side of Pantry Brook. Walked nearly half a mile before
seeing or hearing anything of interest. At the wooded island
heard a short-billed Marsh Wren & a Henslow's Sparrow almost
simultaneously. Went towards the former and found a
colony of about ten [male]s singing over a space of perhaps
twenty acres. Searched a long time for nests circling about
the spot where I first saw each [male]. Found only one nest,an
unfinished & evidently "false" one. Finally flushed a brood of
young bob-tailed but able to fly well. Then gave it up
and shooting two [male]s I left the place in disgust. The grass was
nearly as tall as my head and very dense. It was of the
usual firm meadow king. The [male] wrens sang almost
continuously, usually from a tall stalk of Eupatoreae
(now just coming out) or Archangelica.
  Circling about the island I flushed a [female] [?] [?]
that had a worm in her bill. A few yards further on
