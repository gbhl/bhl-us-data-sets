May 9
Concord, Massachusetts
  Cloudless, warm in the morning, chilly with east
wind in the afternoon.
[margin]Drive to

  Starting at 8 a.m. I drove to Cambridge over 
the usual road, via Sandy Pond and Lincoln.
As I entered in the Sandy Pond woods I noticed that 
the leaves had started since yesterday the birches,
hazels and poplars showing a thing, gauzy veil of 
green. The shad bush was in full bloom, the 
maples still crimson with flowers.
  Birds were abundant and in full song. A 
Wood Thrush, Grosbeak, several Chestnut sided and 
Nashville Warblers were heard in various directions
almost simultaneously. Next I saw a Lanager and 
shortly another, both males of course and very
conspicuous in the leafless oaks in which they
were flitting about; our sand as I was passing.
  I also heard a Solitary Vireo singing superbly near
the middle of the woods.

  Nothing more of special interest during the
remainder of the drive. Orioles were surprisingly
numerous; I must have seen and heard at
least 25 male's besides a single female. Warbling Vireos
were also common. I did see, or rather hear, one 
very interesting bird at the Cross roads near the 
Tricky place in Watertown, making less in fact
trace a House were now an uncommon if not
more opens in the country.

  Returned late in the afternoon by the 
same road. Comparatively few birds seen but Towhers,
Thrashers and Robins singing freely. Also heard
three Wood Thrashers (two in Sandy Pond woods
and saw a fine male Grosbeak. In the willows
