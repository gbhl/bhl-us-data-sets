Sudbury Marshes, Wayland, Mass.
  Clear still and very hot.

the first bird I heard was an Orchard Oriola singing in

unusual were singing side by side with the C palustris the
latter, of course, inhabiting clumps of canary grass which
was interspersed with the finer native grasses. Of the 
C. palustris I got about a dozen losing many more

meadow (P.carolina, R. virginianus, in about equal 
numbers) and one Bittern. In some swampy woods
bordering the meadow I heard a Parula singing and 
high in the heaven overhead a Breter lineatus, the
first I have seen near here this year, was screaming
