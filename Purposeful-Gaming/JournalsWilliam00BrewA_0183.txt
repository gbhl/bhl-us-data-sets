sighted and quick to take alarm when sitting.  I found a great 
many eggs and only took a small number chosen to show as 
great range of variation as possible.
  On my way back to the house I kept well inland following 
the higher and barer ridges. As I approached the N.E. end of the 
island the Wilson's Terns increased in numbers and it became 
evident that by far the larger colony or part of the colony

a number of Roseate Terns. They rose on all sides of 
me and dove down past my head like so many 
angry bees uttering the cloth-ripping note incessantly.
