1886
Aug. 31
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Cloudy, lowering morning; heavy thunder shower
at noon, afternoon dull with steady, light rain. A 
muggy day, close and uncomfortable.
  Drove to the ice-pound in A. M. and spent 
two or three hours in the woods on the east side
having the team return for me at noon.
  In the pines by the ice house were a few
Wood Pewees, Black-throated Green Warblers, and
one Mniotilta (an adult singing) forming a mixed
flock of small rise. I found a usual larger
flock in the woods to the east of the pond,
really a larger flock for their reason comprising
about fifty birds among which I identified
the following: 8 Chickadees, 2 Sitta Canadensis,
2 Picus pubescens, 2 D. vireos, D. pennsylvanica,
6 H. rufricapella, Parula, Mniotilta, 2 Letophaya
(young) and one Vireo olivaceus.  These birds cover
in low bushes, feeding on Aphidae, where I first 
struck these but they soon took to the tall pines
working rapidly through the woods and keeping 
so simple up that it was difficult to identify
them.  I had rather bad luck shooting and got
only five birds from this flock.

  After leaving them I tramped about for some 
time without seeing anything besides a few
Jays and Robins.  But finally from a low-
lying birch cops apparently deserted of birds I 
"screeched" out a Connecticut Warbler and shot
it at close range.

  This ended the day for the shower came
up and I got thoroughly wet before the buggy came.
