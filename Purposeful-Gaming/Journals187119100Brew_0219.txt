screaming in the distance. It was deliciously warm 
in the sun, just a bit chilly in the shade.
  After finishing lunch and a cigar I took a
long tramp through the neighboring thickets and
fields. In scattered birches intermingled with
low pined I stumbled on a pair of Turtle Doves
so young that they could hardly fly. They were
very tame in the first instance and comparatively
so after talking to the  trees but to save my life
I could not see them sitting. After more time
I made a snap shot at one as it flew from 
a birch and killed it. An old bird was near 
at hand bit I only heard its wings as it was very
shy. I saw another flying over Fairhaven.

  In these same birches I shot a D. palmarum,
my first Mass. specimen. I was very near losing 
it as it plunged into some dense scrub oaks when
I found it by the merest chance just as it was
dying.

  On the way down river shot a Marsh Hawk just
below Nine Acre bridge by running the boat into 
the grass which it was yet a long way off and
screeping as it approached. It came directly to me
& only [?] when within ten yards.

  In the [?] flags below red bridge heard a Marsh
Wren (C. Palustris) singing in an undertone and
pushing in shot it easily enough as it was very tame.
On Edwin Bassett's lawn there were about 15
Meadow Larks, one singing. Also a Rail in the flags.

  Saw three Grebes (P. Podiceps), and a little before
sunset a flock of about thirty [?], the first.
Also saw a balloon spider cross the river. Only one white
water lily to-day, probably the last. It was half open at 4 P. M.
