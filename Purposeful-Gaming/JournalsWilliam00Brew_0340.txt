  At 7 o'clock P. M. we took the stage for Asby,
a distance of about four miles. The evening
was still and birds were singing freely. We heard
several Cat Birds, one Hermit Thrush and one Wood
Thrush; the latter singing in an apple orchard,
the Hermit in a pasture grown up with young
pines. Upon reaching Asby we went to the
house of Mr. Brooks where we settled for the re-
mainder of our stay. Two Whippoorwills were
singing a short distance from the house up to
the time we went to bed.
