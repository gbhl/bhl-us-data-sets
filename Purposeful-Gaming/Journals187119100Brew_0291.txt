I also got a female D. Castania in the birches near 
this bend. It was with several Black-polls and a 
Canada Flycathcer.
  Canada Flycatcher by the way, were numerous
everywhere and singing very fiery. Lanagers were 
also numerous but accountability silent. Grosebeaks,
on the other hand, were singing on every side.
I give them the palm over all other birds of this 
royalty, as I did last year. Such richness, such
inexpressible tenderness as they throw into their notes!
They have a mating song which  I heard twice today
which surpasses the ordinary performance of which,
however, it is merely an amplified evasive with
tender trills and low liquid notes added.
  The migration of late birds seemed to be about 
at its height. I wish I could have been in
the woods yesterday but perhaps then were no
more migrants then than I found to-day.
