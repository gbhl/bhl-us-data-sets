1887                      
Sept. 20  
MAINE, (L. Umbagog.)
Clear and cool with high, gusty N.W. wind.
  I had engaged Duncan Sargent to take me up Cambridge
River and was to meet him at Late House. Accordingly I
started from Lakeside about 8 a.m. and sailed across.
Passing the mouth of Ryerson's pond I discovered about a dozen
Ducks sitting on the muddy shore. They had white breasts
which were turned towards me & first attracted my attention.
I could not make them out through the glass but thought
them Whistlers. Upon reaching the Lake House & getting Duncan
I returned to this pond but the Ducks were gone.

description with its dark pools, sunlit reaches, and brilliant
autumn coloring along the banks. Nothing to break the
silence save the occasional chirp of some small bird in
the elders, the rattle of a Kingfisher or the snickering
of a red squirrel. At length turning a sharp bend we
came suddenly on two Black Ducks. They rose at
once &[and] I shot both barrels, missing with my first but
bringing down the rear bird with the second after
it had disappeared, for I fired through the bushes.

  A few turns further on I shot another Black Duck
in the water. It was feeding close to the bank & did
