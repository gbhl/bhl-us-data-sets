The snow melted a great

the weather was mild and
pleasant. Recited all our

our cards. Order of recitations,

Mr. Orn gave us a very long
lesson for to - morrow but we

In P.M. went first up to
the Russells & then to the 
Deane's & spent the P.M. snowballing
with Ruth. Did not get
home till 6 P.M. In the

about my Latin & did not get

  Sun rose clear but it soon
clouded up. Cloudy most of
the day. Sun shone occasionally.
Ther. 20 [degrees] - 40 [degrees] - 31[degrees].
Got up at 6 A.M. to study
my Greek. One of the boys
(Wellington) was suspended
to day. On the way from
school called in at David
Brewer's and bought a pair
of pinnated grouse to stuff
and spent nearly an hour
in selecting them. Got home
at 3 P.M. In the P.M. R. Deane
came down & we snowballed
for about an hour. Then I 
came in & played a game of croquet.
Went up to the Russell's in
the evening but the Latin was
comparitively easy. Got home
at 9.30 P.M. The sleighing is all used up.
