1887
Oct. 14
Great Island, Hyannis, Mass.
Clear and cold with high N.W. wind.
  Left Boston at nine o'clock A.M. with Messrs. Cory,
Henshaw and Chamberlain for a shooting trip to 
the former's game preserves on Great Island.
  Reached the island at 1 P.M. During the drive
down saw a flock of about thirty Golden Plover and
a bunch of Greater Yellow-legs near the entrance gate.
After lunch entered the park to hunt [?] Pheasants.
Chamberlain and I took one direction, Cory & Henshaw 
another. Entering some dense scrub I heard Crows mobbing
and Owl and attempted to find the latter but failed.
I started a deer in the scrub and the animal in its
first rush put up a fine cock Pheasant which made 
a tremendous racket, crowing and producing a curious
rattling sound with its wings. It treed [?] [?] young
pitch pines. I tried to stalk it but it soon flew again 
going off like a rocket over the trees. I did not have 
half a chance for a shot. 
  In the [?] opening we found H. & C. They had 
seen several large bucks and C. had fired a long shot
at a fox. The carriage coming up [?] drove outside to
the lighthouse and thence around the park. On the 
way saw a Passerculus princeps. 
  Cory then drove home leaving us to hunt the sand
hills for P. princeps. We started only a few P. savanna.
The team returning we drove back around the park, 
seeing two Greater Yellow. [?] by the way at which 
H. fired two barrels & I one - all long shots probably
without effect though one bird seemed to be slightly
wounded. 
  At the lighthouse I tramped through a turnip 
field in search of Sparrows. A large bevy of Quail
