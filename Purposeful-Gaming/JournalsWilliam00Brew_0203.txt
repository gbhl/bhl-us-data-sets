1889
Jan'y 19
Washington D.C., to Richmond, Va.
Clear and cool.
  Left Washington at 11 a.m. for Charleston
S.C. The country between Washington and
Richmond along the lines of the railroad is
similar, in general appearance, to Massachusetts
being very broken and hilly with deep ravines.
Pinus inops seems to be the most numerous
and characteristic pine. there are many
oaks of various species all leafless of course.
The fields are brown and bare but in some
of the towns the grass was faintly green on
sunny banks. I saw few birds. Two large
flocks of Agelaius phoenicius and a single
Zenaidura near Quantico. In places immense
flocks of Crows fairly blackening the fields
Cathartes aura almost constantly in sight.
Not a single Duck or other water fowl off
the fifteen miles or more of Potomac shore
which the railroad skirts.
  After passing Petersburg, Va. I saw a few
Larks (Sturnella) and inummerable Sparrows
which rose from Cornfields and stubble as
the train passed. I took them to be Pooecetes
but could not make sure.
