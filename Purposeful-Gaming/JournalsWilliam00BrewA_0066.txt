Suwanee River, Florida.
creek and countless Parulas and Yellow-throated
Warblers singing in the cypresses. Heard a 
Pine Linnete distinctly and also saw the
bird fly from one cypress to another. Turtles
numerous as usual. Saw three alligators one
a rather large one. Came upon three men
cutting cedar and visited their camp. They
say there are no Limpkins on this river.
  Came back to dinner. Three Bank Swallows
passed the boat. Dr. Allen and Chapman came
in neither of them having fired a shot.
  In the afternoon I started out again taking
a creek on the west side and going up it 
a mile or more. Heard a great crashing in
the bush & saw grass & the next moment a
Ward's Heron started out within fifteen feet
of me. I did not shoot. Shortly afterwards
a Florida Cormorant tried to pass, coming
from down stream, and I killed it. At 
the report of my gun an Osprey dropped a
fish it was carrying. An Eagle (adult) tried
to pick it up when the Osprey & its mate
attacked him fiercely & drove him off but
they did not attempt to secure their fish.
  My creek proved very beautiful, narrow
winding with palmettos, cypresses & sweet grass
arching over its glossy surface. The swampy 
woods silent and impressive. Occasionally a 
gray squirrel barked, a Log Cock called or a
Cardinal or Carolina Wren sang. Mullet were
jumping freely. Came back in the twilight, 
Frogs croaking, a bull frog bellowing. Yellow-crowned
Night Herons flying about quaking in cracked tones.
