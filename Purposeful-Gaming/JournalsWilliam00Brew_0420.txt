Almost immediately started on into the bushes where it
lay. I could not find it again, nor did I succeed
in starting any more Grouse although I worked
over a good deal of ground.
  During this tramp I saw nothing but the Chickadees
and Kinglets just mentioned, a few Tree Sparrows, and
a brown Eagle (Haliaetus), the latter scaling over the
woods.
  In the afternoon I went out again with Barnard
Hinckley taking the road south to the Goodspeed opening.
Found the tracks of a small bevy of Quail in the
snow in a weed field but could not start them.
The puppy showed some interest here snuffling the
ground excitedly but not stopping. He is a wild
ranger in the open but I can easily keep him in
sight in dense cover.
  This afternoon we saw a flock of 15 Otocoris and
heard Redpolls (Aeanthis) in the air.
