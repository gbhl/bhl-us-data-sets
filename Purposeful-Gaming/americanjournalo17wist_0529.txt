OBLITERATION OF SUTURES IN SKULL 519 
extensive character and showed a more irregular form. It is 
impossible to divide these cases according to a presumed point of 
View in groups. Therefore I will give only a simple description 
of them. 
Amongst the infantile skulls with milk-dentition (Group I) 
I found the following cases of complicated closure: 
1. On the right side: the posterior half of the squamosal 
suture, the masto-parietal and the masto-occipital suture; on 
the left side: the masto-parietal and masto-occipital suture. 
2. On the right side: the whole of the squamosal suture, the 
masto-parietal and the masto-occipital; on the left side only the 
masto-occipital suture. 
3. On the right side: the spheno-frontal and spheno-parietal 
suture, the lower half of the coronal suture, the posterior half 
of the squamosal suture, the masto-parietal and masto-occipital 
suture; on the left side the spheno-frontal, the spheno-parietal, 
the lower part of the coronal, the lower part of the lambdoid 
and the masto-occipital suture. 
4. The occipital half of the sagittal and the right half of the 
lambdoid sutures. 
5. On the right side: the lower half of the coronal, the hinder 
part of the squamosal, the masto-parietal and the masto-occipital 
suture. On the left side the coronal suture. 
6. The sutura sagittalis totally. On the right side: the 
spheno-parietal, the squamosal, the masto-parietal and masto- 
occipital and the lower half of the lambdoid suture. On the 
left side: the spheno-parietal and the masto-occipital sutures. 
7. The occipital part of the sutura sagittalis. On the right 
side : the spheno-parietal and masto-occipital suture. On the left 
side: the squamosal, masto-parietal and masto-occipital sutures. 
8. The sutura sagittalis. On the right and left side the 
occipital half of the squamosal, the masto-parietal and the 
masto-occipital suture. 
9. The sutura sagittalis. On the right and left side the mesial 
part of the coronal suture. 
Amongst the skulls of Group II the following cases were 
found :
