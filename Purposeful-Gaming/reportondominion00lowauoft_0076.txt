30 CRUISE OF THE NEPTUNE 
Appendix 'No. I., where also will be found a summary of the 
climatic conditions, prepared from the observations by Mr. 
Stupart, Superintendent of the Canadian Meteorological Ser- 
vice. A list giving the thickness, week by week, of the ice in 
the harbour, will also be found in that appendix, and is inter- 
esting as showing to what a late date the ice continues to 
increase, the maximum thickness of seventy-four inches having 
been obtained on the 25th April. 
SPRING EXPLORATIONS. 
On the 11th April Mr. Caldwell left the ship, accompanied 
by five natives, with instructions to explore the coast northward 
to Wager inlet; and if the conditions of weather, food and dog- 
food would 'permit, to continue his work to Repulse bay, 
returning before the ice along the coast broke up. His outfit 
and provisions were carried upon two dog sleds, one of which 
was to return after helping him over the rough ice of the shore 
of Roes Welcome. He succeeded in the exploration of Wager 
inlet, but, owing to the delays caused by bad weather, was 
unable to reach Repulse bay. Mr. Caldwell on his trip did a 
large amount of excellent work in surveying the coast-line and 
examining the rocks met with along the route. 
At the same time Mr. King was engaged, when the weather 
permitted, in making an accurate plan of Fullerton harbour, 
the channel of approach and the environments within a radius 
of thirty miles of the ship. Several hundred soundings were 
made with the aid of the boring machine, the soundings being 
under the charge of Mr. Ross. As a result an accurate chart 
of the harbour and channel has been prepared for the use of the 
ships calling there. 
Owing to the serious illness of Dr. Faribault, whose death 
was expected daily, and to other causes, I could not leave the 
ship on any long trips at this time, and my out-door work was
