a fourth sitting in the top of a leafless alder
feeding on berries of Vibremen opulus. All four Grouse
young females. Saw several Sitta canadensis, Spizella mon-
ticola and Juncos along the banks. Killed with a paddle a 
tiny shrew that came skipping down the bank and tried to
swim across the river looking like a withered leaf. A 
large water beetle rising high in the air in the twilight 
and flying off over the woods.

October 23. Clear and cool with strong north-west wind.
  Off at nine o'clock in the forenoon with Baker,
Gerrish and Alva, driving down to Thale Brown's where we 
left our horses and struck into an extensive larch swamp on 
the east side of the Cambridge. In this swamp we spent the 
day, searching especially for Spruce Grouse. Alva found 
and shot a fine Cock which was sitting on the ground on a 
knoll. He also shot a common Ruffed Grouse. I shot a King-
fisher and three Canada Jays, one of which escaped after I 
had almost caught him. I also saw and shot at a Winter Wren
Heard Pine Crossbeaks twice and Redpolls once. Only other 
birds six Parus hudsonicus (four in one flock, two in an-
other). Tree Sparrows along the brook in alders, a mixed
flock of Chickadees, Kinglets, (satrapa) and two Nuthatches 
(canadensis) and one or two Blue Jays. The swamp was a 
dense growth of larches, white spruces and arborvitae,
ground open beneath and carpeted with green moss.
