Lake Umbagog, Maine
1886
tently by a Jager.
  We paddled first to the Coots. They flew at 
about 100 yards and after circling alighted again. Three
Velvet Scoters left them and alighted with the Scaup Ducks.
We next paddled to them getting within about 50 yards. 
Melvin shot one as they rose. I shot both barrels and one 
of the Velvet Scoters dropped. After this we chased these
Ducks for some time, getting several very long shots, but 
killing nothing. I shot a single Sheldrake (M. serrator)
as it came flying past down the Lake.

  Saw two Shrikes flying together due south over
the woods, making a jarring or vibrating sound. I shot a 
single one on the Lake shore. Heard Snow Bunting's twice 
during the day.

  The leaves are nearly all down, and in most 
places the woods are perfectly bare; but there is still
bright foliage in spots. At Bethel the hill-sides were gor-
geous with gold and crimson.

October 14. A chilly cloudy day with a high south-east wind
We started at the usual time and beat closely for Snipe. 
About the floating island we started three and shot two, 
Melvin one and I the other. We crossed the river and shot 
two more, each of us one. Then tried the meadow by the
Stone farm and shot a single Snipe, the only one seen. 
Lunched on B Point in a sheltered cove. Saw an Eagle.
Found tracks, about a week old, of a large Moose on the 
sand beach. Finished the day with a circuit of Great Island.
