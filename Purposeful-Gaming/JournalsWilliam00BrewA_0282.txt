Oct 20
Lake Umbagog, Maine
Cloudy all day with occasional light showers and high
N. wind. Warm in the early morning (42 [degrees]) getting colder 
through the day. Saddle-back and Speckled Mt. snow
capped. 
  At breakfast time Jim looked the Lake over carefully
with the glass from our observatory in the tall
pine in front of the camp but no Ducks were
in sight. About noon, however, two flocks appeared
in the Lake off B. Brook Cove. The turned out to
be a flock of about 25 White-winged Scoters, all adult 
males and a flock of about a dozen Old Squaws
eight of which were old drakes. Jim paddled me out 
after them in the afternoon but the scoters rose
at fully 200 yds and the Old Squaws at fully 80 yds. 
I shot both barrels at the latter without effect.

  In the forenoon I sailed my canoe for two hours
or more beating up to the Outlet, running down
river to  Moll's Carry and thence back to camp. 
The wind blew a gale as I came in and although
I had only the small sail and that reefed
the boom snapped in two just before I made
the wharf. At the Outlet I heard Greater Yellow-legs

whilstling and sailed past a Black Duck which
was feeding among some half submerged grass. The 
latter was unusually tame for not only did it
not notice me at all but a little later the
steamer passed within 100 yds of it without 
starting it.

  While chasing the "Sea Ducks" in the afternoon
Jim and I saw several Red-throated Loons.

They flew about very freely and made a 
noise between the quack of a Duck and the honk
