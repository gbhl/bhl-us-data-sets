1888
Sept. 19
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Cloudy with a few gleams of sunshine.
Lake calm all day. To Glasby cove in
A.M. While creeping up to the pond hole
looking for Ducks, I started a fox among
the long grass. I shot #4 at his head
and after running about 100 yds. he
stopped and sat down when I finished
him with a thread wound cartridge.
On the way back to the boat shot a [male] juv
Pigeon Hawk. It chased a Flicker in play
then alighted on a tall stub. It uttered
a clattering cry. Skirting the shore to
the south came upon two Pileated Woodpeckers
and shot a thread-wound at one but
missed. Landed at the point north of B.
cove and Lumen made a long circuit
into the cove with the boat. First four
Sheldrake came passing within 30 yds.
I made a clean double killing both
birds stone dead. Next a single Shel-
drake which fell broken-winged and
gave us a long chase out into the Lake.
Lunched on the sand beach at Black
Island. Nothing in the cove but four
Herons circling over. Returning in P.M.
Lumen paddled on within long range
of a pair of Whistlers. They flew and I
dropped one broken-winged. We had
a long pursuit but finally shot it
again.
