Sandpiper only a few days old squatting under a broad
leaf.
  Next sailed down around Cape Pog[?]. Saw thin Herring 
Gulls, all gray birds, flying over the sand hills. Pairs
of [?] Terns sitting on the beaches & lobster buoys.
Off the Cape a White-winged [?] in mottled, ragged 
plumage but able to fly strongly when our boat passed
him to take wing. A small colony of Bank Swallows
(counted 18 holes) in the sand bluff at the end of
the Cape, the only ones I have seen on this island.
  We had intended going around this island but
the wind being light we returned and went to Katama.
Nothing of interest except a Duck which looked like
a [?] but which dove before I could identify him
fully.
  Got back to the house at 5 P.M. After tea took
a walk through the town. It is very much like 
Nantucket twenty years ago. Yellow Warblers, Red-eyes,
Robins & a [?] [?] [?]. Chimney Swifts
in great numbers & a few Barn & [?]
Swallows. King bird & Chippus but no Least Flycatchers,
[?] [?] or House Wrens. English Sparrows rather 
[?]. One Song Sparrow [?] in a garden.
