1886
Oct. 3
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and still; a fine day but slightly chilly.
  In the morning took a long drive with
Henshaw, first through Estabrook woods, never 
past Deacon Farrar's and around the circle
by Robbin's Miles.  Birds very numerous but 
nothing of special interest. H. shot two T. pallosi
We saw a fine adult male circus.
  In the afternoon went up Assabet to
one-acre bridge. Near Bird's Nest Island came on
a flock of about fifteen Quiscalus anueus
scattered about tin the birches on the sunny 
side of the river.
  Further on a right Heron started from 
the trees on the bank and some crows chased 
a Buteo lineatus past us.
  Still further up H. shot a Rhyacophilus
that was feeding on the mud on the edge of the water.
  We landed and took a long tramp in
the birch swamp but saw nothing except two
Grouse one of which was drumming.
  D. Coronata numerous to-day: D. Striata
gone by or nearly so T. albicollis and 
Juncos everywhere.
