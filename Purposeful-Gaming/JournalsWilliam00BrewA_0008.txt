Cambridge, Mass.
WM Brewster 3/4
yesterday.
  We next crossed the big marsh north of Glacialis. No
birds. The marsh as oozy & free from frost as in October.
We half expected to start a Snipe or Rail.
  Near Beech Island saw a Swamp Sparrow. It flew from
the [cast?] path into a bed of cat-tails. We "screeped" and
made it show itself twice, once breast to. There were three
Song Sparrow with or near it.
  Next crossed Little River and looked for Meadow Larks 
in the fields beyond. Faxon saw seven there early in 
Dec. but we could find none to-day. In Robin roost 
swamp found Woodcock droppings not more than a week
or two old and saw a Tree Sparrow, three Chickadees & two
Redpolls.
  Next through the Maple Swamp. No birds there except
a few Tree Sparrows and a flock of ten Chickadees in
willows on the Watertown branch track where the path 
enters the swamp. 
  Finished with the Brickyard swamp where we
heard a Song Sparrow.
  During the day I counted nine different
Song Sparrows and Faxon thinks he saw fully
eight that I did not see.
  I walked home from the crossing where
I parted with Faxon.
