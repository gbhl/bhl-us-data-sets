Waltham, Lincoln and Belmont, Mass
Morning cloudy, clearing by 10 a.m. Remainder of 
day sunny with fleecy clouds. Wind S.W., soft and strong.
  Off with Chapman at 8 a.m. for a day's excusion
inland. We drove up past the Warren place and
then took the back [?] to Lincoln past the 
[?] church. Made our first stop on
the north side of Prospect Hill where we tied the
horse and followed a wood path that wound
up the north-west side of the hill making two
[?ditches] down into narrow, deep glens. A good
many birds here including three or four Tanagers, 
two Wood Thrushes (both males singing) a Bicknell's 
Thrush, a Canadian Warbler, an Indigo Bird and 
the usual number of Red-eyes, Creepers ([?])
etc. I shot the Canadian Warbler and wounded the
Bicknell's Thrush badly but lost the latter. As
we came out at the road on our return found
a flock of eight or ten Cedar Waxwings feeding
in an oak nearly over our buggy. 
  We drove five or six miles before stopping again
seeing a small Buteo, which we both felt sure
was B. pennsylvanicus, near the spot where the 
road passes the great boulder and not far from
the swamp where [?F'razar] found a nest of
a Great-horned Owl years ago. Common birds
[?] numerous everywhere along this road.
  In the picturesque wooded hollow just below
(east of) the cemetery in Lincoln we halted
for lunch. There were several intersting birds
here, a Buteo borealis sailing high overhead, 
a pair of Phoebes, the [female] sitting on four eggs in
