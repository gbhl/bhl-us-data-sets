1887
May 11
Concord, Massachusetts.
Much cooler this morning, with high N. W. wind.
  Off at 9:30 driving to the Estabrook woods and
having George return for the mat 1 P.M.
  A Solitary Vireo singing near the entrance to
the woods. Afterwards saw three more, two of them
a mated pair.
  Visiting the Harry Woodpecker's nest found
it deserted no new hole in the tree.
  A Phoebe singing near probably had a rust
in our of the old liner quarries but I searched
them carefully without finding it.
  A pair of Lanagers in these woods, the male 
absurdly conspicuous in the leafless trees. I saw
him nearly 100 yards away.
  Crossing the road to the east side I tramped
through wood and pastures without seeing much
of interest. In a corner among ground jumper
I flushed a pair of Oliver backed Thrushers and 
shot them both. They were silent and rather
shy. In the same spot I also saw a little 
company of Zone albricollis.
  Only a very few birds were singing among
them Minotilla, D. Vireos, D. Pennsylvania,
and an occasional Thrasher or Cat Bird. The 
high wind swayed through the trees but the
day was otherwise bright, warm and pleasant.
  Before starting in the morning I saw a 
Sparrow pitch into the lilacs at the N.E. corner
of the Manse. Approaching I found him hopping
about among the stems, skulking behind them
in a way that lead me at once to suspect
what he proved to be where a moment later
