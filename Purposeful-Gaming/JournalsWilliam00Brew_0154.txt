my shot she lowered her flight and
scaling out nearly 60 yds. struck
the surface of the Lake. I then fired
my other barrel at her head and
killed her. Besides these birds we
saw two large flocks of Black Ducks
which passed over high and two
Buffle-heads (seen by Lumen) which
scaled over the end of the point. In
the twilight heard two Wilson's Snipe
flying over the meadow.
