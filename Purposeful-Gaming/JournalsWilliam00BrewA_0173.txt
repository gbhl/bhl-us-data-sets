Clear and very warm with strong N.W. wind changing to N.E in P.M.
[margin]"Search for 
"Kicker's" nest.[/margin]
  At 10.A.M. donned my wading boots and went to the 
little marsh behind the Howard's to look for the Kicker or his
nest. I could find no bird of any kind in the marsh but
near the spot whence the mysterious voice came last evening
I came upon a curious nest which I believe to be that
of a Little Black Rail. It is carefully described in my notes
under P. jamaicensis so I will not repeat myself here save by
saying that It was in a very open place and resembled
somewhat the crown of an old straw hat with the opening 
down for it was completely domed over with a small entrance
on one side. Two cur dogs, which were unsolicited companions
of my search, ransacked the marsh pretty thoroughly without
starting any birds whatever.
As I was sitting on the piazza writing early this
afternoon I heard the h√†-ha of a Black-headed Gull and
soon afterwards his full laughing cry. He was apparently
flying along the shore but I could not get sight at him.
  At 7 P.M. started off with C. in the buggy on a hunt for
"Kickers". First drove westward a mile or more along the road
that follows the beach ridge. Inside this road lie a series
of fresh or brackish ponds surrounded by marshes of varying characters.
One of the larger has extension beds of tall dark green rushes in
which Red-wings were breeding in great numbers and a 
single Maryland Yellow-throat singing. There were also Savanna
Sparrows in extrordinary numbers about the edges of these marshes
and along the sand-hills that formed the beach ridge. I
listened in vain for Sharp-tails at several promising
places. Twice I thought I heard a "Kicker" in the distance.
Saw two Spotted Sandpipers and a Night Heron, the
latter flying high over one of the ponds. Song Sparrows
