1867
Sunday, January 6.
  Cloudy all day. Snowed all A.M.
till one P.M. About three inches
of snow had fallen during the night
and three more fell in the forenoon.
Went to church and sabbath
school in A.M. but was late to
the former. Theo. Russell was admitted
into the church this A.M. Bill
was but little better today so
I had to go down and tell
John Torvig to shovel out the
snow. On the way home from
church saw several redpolls, snow
birds, and five snow buntings.
Read most of P.M. but in the
latter part walked up to Mt. 
Auburn and looked at my
squirrel trap but they had
not been near it. Read all the evening

Monday, January 7.
  Alternately cloudy and clear.
2nite cold and very windy.
The snow drifted a good deal.
Got a ride in a private sleigh
from the Colleges to Hovey's.
In P.M. stuffed the white 
breasted nuthatch shot
Saturday and wound the
tow into a ball for the first 
time. Had to stuff for about
an hour after dinner in
order to finish the nuthatch.
Then studied on my Caesar
till 9.30 P.M. and got it out
without help. Fathers new
mare had a sort of fit when
she came in from a drive this 
P.M. and could hardly walk
