1887
Sept. 9
MAINE, (L Umbagog)
Clear with high N.W. wind.
  To Sargent's clearing in the forenoon for Woodcock.
Started four, all of which I killed in five shots. One
of them was among spruces, the others along the edges
of willow thickets. The fourth bird went off apparently 
unhurt after I had fired both barrels at him but
Don found him twenty rods or more in from the
edge of the woods lying dead with his wings spread
out. Woodcock are fast getting over the moult and
two of the birds killed to-day whistled loudly.

  In the afternoon I tried the Cambridge marshes.
Landed first on the left bank and beat the marsh
about the floating island. Just as I was leaving
it a Snipe appeared high in air, having evidently
come from a distance, and pitched down into
the grass. I worked Don up to the spot but he
flushed the bird apparently without scenting him.
He however "pointed dead" on him after I shot him.
I killed a Carolina Rail in this meadow & another
on the opposite side of the river.

  Returning to the boat I was filling my pipe
when a Wood Duck alighted a little way above me.
After reconnoitering a moment it swam in shore &
swam slowly towards me, once landing and running
nimbly up the bank nearly to the grass. At length
it came within range & I shot it sitting.

  By this time it was nearly sunset and I concealed
myself in the grass in the hope of getting a shot
at some Ducks that I have seen flying about over
the marshes at that hour. I was unsuccessful although
five Wood Ducks passed nearly within range &
four whistled also came directly over my hiding place
