1888
May 18
Oden, Michigan
Cloudy with frequent shows. Wind N. E. Cooler than yesterday
but still not at all a chilly or raw day.
  Spent most of the day on the house but took
a short walk in the morning along the shore past
the bath house, a fairly long tramp late in the
afternoon through the upland clearing opposite the
station & well into the woods beyond. Expected to
find a heavy flight of migrants but the fields
and woods were alike nearly deserted. Evidently
the flight of yesterday had passed on and no
new migrants taken their places. Saw two fair
sized flocks of Warblers in the woods but both
were composed of what it seems safe to consider
resident summer species such as D. virens, D. maculosa
Parula etc. Saw only two D. palmarum. A Regulus 
satrapa singing in some hemlocks. A Wood Thrush
in full song late in P. M. in an arbor vitae swamp
near the station. Tanagers still in the open fields.
The combination of Tanagers, Tree Sparrows, Palm
Warblers, Juncos, Winter Wrens, and three toed Woodpeckers
in bush, rock, maple & arbor vitae woods on the same
day is certainly a strange jumble as compared
with faunal, floral, & seasonal conditions in the East.
  I am again struck by the silence of birds here.
To day with its mild, soft air, gentle showers and
lowering "open & shut" skies should have been a
capital singing day. Yet I only heard a very
few birds & the woods were often entirely silent.
