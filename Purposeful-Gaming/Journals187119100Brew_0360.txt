Sept.17  
MAINE. (L. Umbagog.)
Clear with high N.W. wind.
  To the extreme upper end of the Sargent clearing
(where the Mollidgewark path enters the woods) in
the forenoon, having heard of Woodcock there.
This report proved true for I found four birds
and shot three of them. All were among [?]
two on the edge of spruces the other two quite in
the open. The first two birds were very shy and
cunning rising and flying so as to keep out of sight
behind the spruces. I fired two hard shots at them
without success and finally lost them both.
After killing the second and third birds in
two shots I returned to the first and after a
long search, found one of them. I put him
up  twice without getting a shot but at the
third rise I caught a sight at him just as he
was disappearing over a tall poplar from 40 yds.
away: I fired but had no expectation of hitting.
On going to the spot, however, Don found him
wing-tipped and retrieved him. It was the
best shot I have made this season.

  In a patch of corn by a house I saw two
Indigo Birds. Both in brown plumage. Heard a 
Ruby-crowned Knight in some thick spruces.
Several flocks of Rusty Blackbirds flitting along
fences by the roadside.
  Late in P.M. sailed down to the Dalton House
to see Crocklin & Skillings who had just come out.
They had a [female] Surf Scoter shot near Metallac Island.
At sunset saw a single Chimney Swift skimming
over the hill. Skillings & Crocker had almost no shooting.
Four Golden Plover were killed at Outlet.
