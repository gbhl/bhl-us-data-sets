1886
July 7
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Cloudless but with the sun obscured by a 
smokey haze; despite this and a strong S.W. wind 
the heat was possibly stifling.
  In the forenoon took a long drive with
D., to him are corner and around by way of
Lincoln, thence back by Sandy Pond.

  I was curious ot see how the birds would
behave this third day of extreme head. To my
surprise they seemed active and sang freely. I 
heard a Tanager, Warbling Vireo, many Red-edyes
and Long Sparrows, several Bluebirds and Cat birds,
a Fowlher and numerous others.

  The rather hidden and almost complete
disappearance of the Orioles is remarkable. A 
week ago a few males were still singing and 
young with chattering everywhere; during the 
past five days I have heard none and have
only seen one, a [female].

  In the afternoon sailed down river to 
Ball's Hill. Landing then I spent an hour or
more with D. he botanizing, I looking for birds.
In the thickets behind the ridger birds were 
singing freely at 5 P.M. Wilson's Thrushes, Towhees,
Maryland Yellow-Throats, Cat Birds and Song Sparrows
being among the more prominent. On the way 
up river I heard one or two Yellow Warblers but 
no Bobolinks although we heard several of the 
latter yesterday.

  At sunset the air was literally filled
with Swallows and swifts skimming over the 
meadows. There were hundreds in sight at once
