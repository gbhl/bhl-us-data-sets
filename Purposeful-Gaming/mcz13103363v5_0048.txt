  Morning broke cloudy 
but the sun soon came
out. Ther. about 40[degrees] - 70[degrees]

day that we have had.
Bill left us this morning.
At about 9a.m. started
shooting taking Dart.
Beat the swamps as 
far up as Belmont &
then came home across
the fields. Shot a Rusty 
Blackbird flying &
saw four or five others.
Found a Nuthatch &
a Chikadee scooping 
out their holes for the 
reception of their nests.
Saw turtles, frogs (speckled)
two kinds of butterflies.
& moneybugs. Fresh pond 
is still covered with ice but
it is full of channels & must
soon break up. In P.M. stuffed
the Redwing shot Thursday.
[margin]In evening called on J. Nichols & the Russells'.[/margin]

ively hot. Ther. about

Walked down to and
home from church.
In the P.M. J. Nichols

them. In the evening
looked over Mr. Davenport's
collection & he came in
