differentiated. Six chromosomes have been counted in the 
dividing spermatogenous cells of Mnium and Polytrichum, 
two common mosses, six is probably the number in Blasia and 
Porella two of the liverworts, while three other liverworts, 
Ricca, Marchantia and Fegatella have eight chromosomes 
each. 
The androcyte, that is the cell destined to be transformed 
into the sperm, whether it is triangular in outline as the result 
Of an oblique division or not, is constructed on the same general 
plan as the androcyte mother-cell just described. We find a 
definitely organized protoplast consisting of a nucleus and 
cytoplasm, the latter bounded apparently by a very 
delicate plasma membrane. Somewhat conflicting re- 
ports have been made recently as to the nature of the pro- 
cesses occuring as this androcyte becomes transformed into 
the mature sperm. In addition to the presence of nucleus and 
cytoplasm, there is quite general agreement as to the early 
appearance somewhere within the cytoplasm of a conspicuous 
dark staining body, the blepharoplast. The origin and nature 
of this body is as yet a matter of dispute. Whether it functions 
in the growth processes of the cilia or has to do with the change 
in form of the androcyte, or possesses other entirely distinct 
functions, it certainly forms the base of attachment of the 
cilia. 
Briefly the transformation of the androcyte as the writer 
has observed it in Mnium, one of the common mosses, is as 
follows: (I find practically similar processes occurring in 
Marchantia, Blasia, Porella and Fegatella.) The protoplast 
of the androcyte rounds off slightly from the cell wall. The 
blepharoplast appears in the cytoplasm near the plasma mem- 
brane apparently as a cytoplasmic differentiation in the andro- 
cyte in which it is to function. The blepharoplast grows as a 
more or less radially flattened band in a course closely applied 
to the plasma membrane. The nucleus becomes closely ap- 
plied to the blepharoplast, the chromatin network and nucle- 
olus, if the latter is present, changing meanwhile in structure 
so that eventually the entire nucleus stains quite homogen- 
eously. The nucleus lengthens parallel with and becomes more 
and more closely applied to the blepharoplast, so that the two 
form first a crescent and then a coil of one or two turns. The
