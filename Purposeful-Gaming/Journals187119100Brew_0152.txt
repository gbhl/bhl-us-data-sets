1886
Aug. 1
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and hot, clouding over about 5 P.M Evening
cloudy and threatening rain. Wind S.W. fresh.
  At 2P.M. started up river with Purdie piking
up Mr. Hoar by the way. The chief object of the trip
was to visit Thoreau's "Lalinia Glance Swamp". It
lies about 1/4 of a mile to the west of Nice Acre Coven
bridge and is very interesting botanically. There is a 
small, deep pool of cold water surrounded by a quality
bog of interlaced roots of Cassandra, Kalina glance,
Andromeda Polyfolia, Laedunn Catifolium and various often
interesting mother plants. The bog is in turn bordered
on every side by a belt of black spruces of from 15 to
30 ft in height. The whole affair, pool, bog and belt
of spruces covers about the area of an ordinary house
and is near the middle of a tangled swamp of 
ordinary Mass. trees and shrubs, birches, blueberry bushes
etc. One night pass within twenty places of the 
pond of the Maine woods embedded in the Mass ones.
The spruces are rather stumbled and shaggy like
thorn in the Lyler bog at Umbagog.

  It was of course too late to look for interesting 
birds and we saw nothing more remarkable than
a Wilson's Thrush, Maryland Yellow-Throat and some 
Robbins the first and last evidently attracted by
the numerous ripe blueberries. Martins were circling
overhead and four perched on a dead tree top
two of three five adult males.
  Returning to the river we kept one to Fairhaven
when I sailed about the bay which Mr. Hoar and 
P. visited tree slippery else on Lee's Cliff. Thru
