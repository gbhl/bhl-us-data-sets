1889
Oct. 13
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Cloudless with clear bracing air. Wind N. to N.E. Water from
last night.
  At 10 a.m. started for Bottle Brook Pond. Saw nothing
save a single Black Duck flying until we reached the
bend just below Horn Store Pond where I heard a Grouse
drum. Landed & went in search of him. He did not
drum again but I stumbled on him by chance &
hearing a rustle among the leaves saw him run a few
steps & then stop when I shot him. He proved a fine
lay bird. Also shot a [female] Picoides arcticus which was 
pecking at the trunk of a live spruce, attracting my
attention by the noise it made.

  At the next bend started a Merganser which did 
not give me a shot, however.

  Reaching Bottle Brook Pond we lunched and I then 
visited all the coves in succession. To my disappoint-
ment there was not a single Duck of any kind
in the pond. Saw a Canada Jay, a Tree Sparrow,
a Blue Jay & several Robins.

  Next Bear Brook up which we paddled further 
than I have been before. Saw nothing but a
Kingfisher & some Tree Sparrows.

  Next down river. Two hounds running  deer on 
Pine Hill making the woods ring with their deep
voices. We heard several shots on the hill but the
dogs continued giving tongue long afterwards.

  Turned into Pine Hill Pond and killed a Black 
Duck there, a solitary bird which we surprised in
a deep cove & which I shot sitting. Had a rather
long shot at another just after we emerged from
Moll's Carry on our way back to camp but
missed. It came flying towards us as we were in open
water.
