1889
March 21
Marianna,  Florida.
Clear, still and warm, a perfect day.
  Came to Marianna from Tallahassee last evening to hunt
Wild Turkeys. Engaged the services of W. R. Hartsfield, a noted
Turkey caller, who awoke me this morning at 4 o'clock. We
started a few minutes later by wagon and drove out of town about
5 miles by moonlight. The woods very beautiful in the
pale light, the dogwood trees in full bloom showing like silvery
masses among the darker pines. A Pine Warbler sang once. Heard
no other sounds save the chirping of crickets.
  Reached out destination, Baker's plantation, just as the
eastern sky was reddening and driving down to the edge
of a swamp left the horses and entered the woods along the
edges of which Cardinals and White-eyed Vireos were singing and
a pair of Barred Owls hooting and caterwauling. Passing through
a belt of open woods, chiefly of beeches and magnolias with an
undergrowth of Cornus florida, Celtis occidentalis, Halesia diptera and Red-bud,
we came to the edge of a cypress swamp. Hartsfield called
here several times but his yelping yûp-yûp-yûp echoed
among the trees without response. Moving along a few rods
at a time he called again & again but in vain. Meanwhile
I was chiefly occupied with drinking the marvelous beauty
of the woods as the twilight faded and the daylight grew
and in listening to the birds. Such a medley of sound!
I have heard nothing like it since the Welkiva experience
of 1876. The air rang and the woods echoed the sound.
Cardinals. Carolina Wrens, White-eyes, Hermit Thrushes (2), Hooded
Warblers, Mniotiltas, Panulas, D. dominias  and Regulus calendula
all singing as they would burst their throats and
then the Woodpeckers! In every direction their drumming
and call notes filled the woods. Most of them seemed
to be Centurus carolinus but there was at least one
