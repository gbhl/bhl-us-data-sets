Apr. 9
Yellow Red-poll Warbler (hypoclingsea). The latter was singing.
There were also several Fox Sparrows about this pond.
Heard one hylas there.
  While in this pond our talking etc. started the Red-tails
from the pines and both birds sailed over and
past us many times screaming occasionally. We
visited all the nests and C. tried to climb to
one of them but gave it up after getting half way.
  Started up river at 4 p.m. sailing to Ball's Hill before
a furious wind, the entire meadows being covered
with white caps. Above Ball's Hill paddled a little way, C.
shooting three Red-wings and a Pewee. Then
setting the sail again we ran, close-hauled, nearly
to Flint's bridge.
  At sunset the wind lulled and the air grew warmer.
Red-wings were singing on every side. A Kingfisher (we
saw several earlier in the day) rattled as he passed
high overhead. Near town Robins were singing in the
tops of the elms and maples.
  Below Ball's Hill we saw two or three Ospreys - or, perhaps,
the same bird two or three times - noble birds easy
and graceful of wing, nearly white beneath but
with a dark bar on the under side of each wing
near the carpal joint. One of them whistled several
times.
