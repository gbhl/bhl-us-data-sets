A.M. Ther. at 12 [degrees]; at 10 P.M. 15 [degrees]
On the way home from school
saw about 20 snow buntings
light in Mr. Raymond's yard.
Went down to R. Dana's with
R. Deane in P.M. and played
billiards at his table. Then
went up to my box trap with
Charlie and set a wire 
trap that I bought on the
way home from school.
Went up to the Russell's
in the evening with my
Caesar as the lesson was quite
hard but Mr. Russell went
out before we had translated
much. Father's horse was better
today.

Wednesday, January 9.
  Clear and pleasant but quite
windy. Got a ride down to
the Medges, and a ride up to
them on the was home from
school. On the way to school
saw a flock of about forty
snow buntings and one among
them that looked like a shore lark.
In P.M. rode up to my squirrel
trap & met Charlie there. It was
sprung probably by the wind.
Rode up to Dan's through Wavelly
where I saw about 12 pine grosbeaks.
At Dan's I found Ruth who had
driven his mother up in the sleigh.
Saw a large flock of redpolls there
and tried to shoot some but they
flew. Dan had shot 2 snow buntings.
Rode home with Ruth.
