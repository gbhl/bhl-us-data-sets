Mr. Gilbert Whitley died in Sydney after a short illness in July, 1975. 
Details of various facets of his life and work have been published elsewhere and 
need not be repeated here. The opportunity remains, however, for this journal 
to record the extent of the contributions made by Mr. Whitley to the Royal 
Zoological Society of New South Wales. 
A brief review of Mr. Whitley's association with the Society presents a 
picture of extraordinary service extending over half a century. He was a Member 
of the Society from 1926 until his death, a Life Member from 1938 and a long- 
time Fellow. He served as a member of Council for many years and was 
President or Vice-President on several occasions. A gentle, knowledgeable, 
industrious man with a charming sense of humour, he was highly esteemed as 
a Council Member whose views always deserved consideration.
