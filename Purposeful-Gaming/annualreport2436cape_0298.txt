the strength which so far seems best to use on the 
worms. A very weak mixture may kill the millers, one 
part in 800 having done it thoroughly in tests. 
As cloudiness or dark water, by their reduction 
of the light reaching the plants and the consequent 
dimunition of the process of photosynthesis, cause a 
marked decrease in the oxygen content of the water 
of a cranberry bog flooding to be maintained, it seems 
to follow that, under such conditions of light reduction, 
the 48-hour flooding period heretofore advocated for 
treating this insect may be much reduced and still be 
effective, for the oxygen deficiency should affect the 
worms as well as the plants.
