1887
(Sept. 24) 
proved to be an adult in fine plumage.
  While the guides were pitching the tent etc.I took
a station on the old dam to watch for the evening
flight of Ducks. The sunset was a fine one and
to add to my enjoyment of the beautiful scene
several White-throated Sparrows on the ridge to the
north sang many times in succession and quite
as finely as in Spring. Their clear ringing notes had
an almost startling effect in the general silence.

  The twilight gradually deepened until it became
too dark to shoot and having seen no Ducks I
lost hope and descending to the pool crossed
it in my boat starting a Woodcock from the
alders on its edge. Just as I was landing and
almost before the whistle of his wings died away
 in the distance I heard a rushing sound &
hoarse quacking overhead and looking up saw
a flock of about fifteen Black Ducks hurtling
down the valley.  They were out of shot but
probably passed over the dam within range.

  The evening was windy, the sky cloudy
and finally it began to rain. As we sat by
the fire in front of the tent I head the
cry of a Loon in the distance and later a  
Great Horned Owl hooting.
