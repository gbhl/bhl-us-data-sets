March 6
Oak Hill to Mim's, Florida.
  Hazy with occasional pale sunshine. Warm &[and] still.
  When I awoke this morning Cardinals, Carolina
Wrens, Mocking Birds and Red-winged Blackbirds
were singing about the house. I also heard a
Nonpariel and a Maryland Yellow-throat. There
were only a few Ospreys in sight. I again saw
one plunge head foremost into the water.
  Started for Mim's at 10 a.m. driving slowly
for it was warm &[and] the horses were tired. In the
pines Pine Warblers &[and] Flickers were singing. Saw
several Sparrow Hawks and several large flocks
of D. palmarum. A pair of Shrikes in the orange
grove at Oak Hill were beginning to nest.
  On the palmetto prairie near the creek saw
a pair of Eagles, one adult the other with a
little white on the tail only, pursue and rob
an Osprey. They circled around him &[and] one
getting a little above him swooped &[and]
apparently struck him forcing him to drop
the fish which the Eagle caught before it
reached the ground.
  At the bridge saw three [Frilix] collaris, one a
fine male, swimming  in the creek; also a Florida
Gallinule. Shot a Dove in a pine &[and]
fired at but missed a Buteo alleni. Five
or six Swallows (T. bicolor) flying about over the 
creek. In the [??????] a flock of Cedar Birds
doubtless feeding on mistletoe berries. In the
pond only a single Heron, a white Caruba.
  My shot at the Hawk tempted Robin to
jump from the wagon. He ran along the
road ahead of the horses a few rods and
