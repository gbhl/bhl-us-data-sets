GEOLOGY 191 
The high rocky shores of the eastern and northern sides of 
Salisbury island were closely followed by the Neptune, so that 
the red, crystalline rocks forming its cliffs could easily be seen. 
The prevailing rock was red, or pink, and only occasionally 
were darker masses seen. 
Nottingham, which lies south of Salisbury in the western 
part of Hudson strait, was visited by Dr. Bell in 1884 and 
1885, when he examined the rocks in the neighbourhood of Port 
De Boucherville, in its southeast part, and he there found along 
with the common varieties of gneiss a number of patches of fine- 
grained red syenite. 
Charles island is wholly formed of Archaean gneisses. The 
prevailing rock in the western part is a fine-grained light-gray, 
or pink mica-gneiss, associated with medium to coarse-grained 
mica-hornblende granite-gneiss; the latter cutting and altering 
the light-coloured gneisses. 
Resolution island has never been visited by a geologist, and 
consequently its rocks can only be described from observations 
made while passing it in the ships. The rocks everywhere 
appear to be crystalline Archaean, a red variety predominating. 
The southern shores of Hudson strait from Douglas harbour 
to the mouth of George river in the southeast part of Ungava 
bay were examined by the writer in 1897, and a detailed state- 
ment concerning them is given in the report of that year. The 
remaining portions of this side of Hudson strait were examined 
on the voyage of the Neptune, the part westward from Douglas 
harbour to Cape Wolstenholme while sketching the coast-line 
from the ship, and the greater part of that between Cape Chid- 
ley and the mouth of George river by Mr. caldwell in a boat 
during the absence of the Neptune to the north in 1904. These 
examinations connect with the work of the writer beyond Cape 
Wolstenholme, and thus practicallv finish the examination of 
the north and west sides of the Labrador peninsula.
