1887                                        
Aug.13  
Concord, Massachusetts.
Clear and sparkling weather, almost frosty in
the early morning. Wind north, very light all day.
  Off down river in the canoe at 9.30 a.m. taking
my 12g. gun. As I was passing the landing at
Ball's Hill a Flycatcher darted out from the woods
and turning alighted on the top of the spreading
white oak. At first I felt sure that it was a
Contopus borealis but upon getting nearer I began
to be doubtful as it looked smaller & more like a
Wood Pewee. While I was trying to get a better sight
at it it flew again and disappeared among the
trees. Landing I followed and soon came upon
it sitting breast towards me on a dead branch.
At once I saw that it was a veritable C. borealis
and the next instant it was mine. It is the
first specimen I have ever seen here (in E. Mass.)
after the breading season.
  Continuing on I land at the further end 
of Len Davis' hill and taking a wood path that
I have never explored before came out in the large
field south of the big woods. Crossing this I was 
on the point of entering the wood path that leads
from it at the northern end where I heard a
Carolina Dove utter a single low coo just ahead. I
looked closely for him but in vain. Finally he flew
from a pitch pine and following down the path
alighted again almost immediately cooing again this
time giving the full succession of notes. What an
impressive sound it is! quite the most thrilling
that I know when heard in some lonely spot
such as this was. I listened for many minutes as
the deep solemn tones rose and died away another
