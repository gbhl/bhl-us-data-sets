  I spent the entire morning in a limited area between
the main road, the path in to the lumber camps and
the camps. The woods were dreary and for the most part
silent save for the roughing of the wind in the pines
but occasionally a D. virens sang or a Peabody bird whistled.
Grosbeaks (H. ludoviciana) were singing freely much of the time,
one of them a superb performer. Heard only one Winter Wren
and but one Creeper. Saw a great many small birds,
however. They were collected in small flocks which moved
so rapidly through the woods that it was difficult
to overtake them. I made a fair bag, nevertheless, killing
twenty-four. Lost one Warbler which looked very like H. celata.
It was badly wounded and I nearly caught it but it
fluttered off into a log heap where it was useless to
look for it. Killed a pair of Sitta canadensis at one shot.
The [female] was incubating and had laid all her eggs.
  Dwight left early in the morning and went over
most of the ground which we covered on the 12th. He
met three large flocks of Warblers one containing at
least 25 D. Blackburniai. These flocks moved so rapidly
from tree to tree that he found it impossible to
do anything with them. In one of these flocks he
saw two D. palurareum. Neither he nor I saw any
Pigeons. The foreman of the choppers saw two
yesterday, but none to-day. No grouse drumming
this morning.
  On the drive out we saw an Otocoris praticola in
