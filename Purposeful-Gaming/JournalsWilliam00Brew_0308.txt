about eight Chestnut-sided Warblers, two Indigo-birds, two Field Sparrows,
two Yellow-throated Vireos, at least six Cat-birds, three Wood Pewees
and very many Oven-birds and Red-eyes. In the deep pocket shaped
hollow when we saw so many Grouse last year several Red-wings
were nesting. I heard only one Nashville Warbler but Black & White
Creepers were numerous and in full song although we saw both sexes
carrying food to their young. No Cuckoos or Wilson's Thrushes. A
flock of six or eight Cedar-birds in chestnut woods. One Grouse
flushed.
  Mangus Hill is famous for its ferns. I found a solid bed of
cinnamon ferns at least 30 yds. long by 20 yds. wide, the ferns
five to six feet high forming an almost impenetrable undergrowth
of singularly tropical appearance. There were also clusters of fine
maiden hair ferns in many places.
  Maple leafed Viburnum numerous and in flower. Saw several fairly
large basswoods. Hazel abundant, very few barberry bushes.
