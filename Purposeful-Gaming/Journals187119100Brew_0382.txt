Oct. 15
Great Island, Hyannis, Mass.
Clear and cold with high N.W. wind. 
  Henshaw who was out before breakfast saw a large flock
of Pine Linnets and numerous Warblers, in the garden. 
Immediately after breakfast I found there a large 
flock of D. coronata among which were three Palm Warblers.
I shot two of the latter and found one to be a typical
D. palmarum. 
  Our host supplied us with a trained shooting pony, a 
broncho bought of "Buffalo Bill" last spring, and mounted 
on this animal I started with Henshaw for the 
promontory called the "cow pasture" a barren, more or less
sandy wash of rolling plains sprinkled sparsely with 
stunted cedars and thickets of Bayberry Bushes. Here we
found many Sparrows, Robins, [?] ([?]) and a 
large flock of D. coronata among which were several D. p.
hypochrysca. H. shot two of the latter, a [?] & several
Savanna Sparrows. I killed a [?] princeps and 
a Grass Finch, both from the pony's back. It was great 
fun, galloping about over the wide expanse in the cool
bracing wind.
  Later we scoured the hills near the house. I shot 
a Pine Linnet flying, from the the back of my horse &
missed an Indigo Bird which we found in a patch of weeds
& which H. killed a moment later.
  Cory & Chamberlain hunted deer in the park through
the forenoon but returned without having fired 
a shot. They saw about thirty, mostly does.
  After lunch we all started for the park in the wagon.
On the way I flushed and shot a Meadow Lark, missing
with both barrels at two others. We next stopped at
the lighthouse where H. shot a [?] [?] 
in a patch of weeds. I, meanwhile, beat the
