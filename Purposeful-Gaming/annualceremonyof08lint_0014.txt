attached to a bandoleer of beads or seeds. Instead of 
the bandoleer a gaming ring containing charms was 
sometimes worn on the arm. Each medicine man had 
a bag, generally made from the skin of an animal 
tanned whole, in which he kept his roots, paints, white 
clay, and other objects used in working his cures. The 
latter varied with the individual, but usually consisted 
of deer tails, the leg bones and claws of eagles, human 
bones, dried fingers, and very often the maw stone of 
a buffalo. The last was greatly valued, as it was sup- 
posed to contain the life or soul of the buffalo. The 
medicine men's bags with their contents were usually 
handed down from father to son, or were given to a 
newly initiated medicine man by his instructor. 
The methods used to work cures varied with the 
nature of the disease and the customs of the medicine

to witchcraft could only be treated by some one who 
could work a counter spell. Such diseases were usu- 
ally eradicated by sucking a feather, small stone, 
blood, or some other object from the patient, singing 
and the shaking of a rattle being part of the perform-

the fire and consumed so that the seat or cause of the 
trouble could not enter again into the patient or into 
any one else. All medicine men knew more or less of 
roots and herbs, which they administered as teas or in 
powdered form. The pay of the medicine man, which 
was given him when his services were no longer re- 
quired, varied with the wealth of the patient. It some- 
times consisted of buffalo robes and parfleches of dried 
meat, but was more often a sack of corn or a few 
strands of dried, braided pumpkins. He was paid even 
when he failed to work a cure. 
The supernatural beings from whom the Pawnee 
medicine men derived their powers were, for the most 
part, identified with animals. Not all animals were
