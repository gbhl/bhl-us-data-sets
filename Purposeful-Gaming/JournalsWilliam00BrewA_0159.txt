1890
June 14
Swampscott, Massachusetts
Cloudy with occasional light showers, the clouds breaking away
and the sun coming out for an hour or two in the afternoon.
  Started off with W. A. Jeff[?][?] at 8 a.m. driving out about three
miles to a place on the W. side of the [?] R.R.
  Stopped [?] at a pretty glen with a brook flowing down
the middle and steep slopes on either side covered with
dense thickets of barberry bushes with cedars and pines
crowning the crest of the encircling ridge. A White eyed Vireo
singing in [?] along the brook, a Chat among the
barberries on the hillside, a Cuckoo of each species and 
various common birds among the cedars. Within five minutes
after entering the thickets I found a Chat's nest, empty
but new and neatly finished, in a barberry and not 20
yds. beyond, also in a barberry, a Yellow Billed Cuckoo's
containing five eggs on which the bird was sitting. We found
nothing more here.
  Driving on a half mile or so we entered a larger [?]
of hilly pastures thickly sprinkled with cedars and clusters
of barberries with a large brook winding its way down
a narrow valley. Prairie Warblers, Yellow Warblers, and
Chestnut-sided Warblers in about equal numbers were here
singing on every side. Purple Finches and Vesper Sparrows
with an occasional Field Sparrow and numerous Song
Sparrows. Indigo Birds very common. A Scarlet Tanager
in [?] near the brook, a [?]an [?] in this region
according to Jeff[?][?]. Found a Yellow-Billed Cuckoo nest with 
two eggs & one of the Black-Billed species, a Yellow-Bill sitting 
on the set which was quite fresh.
  Near the head of the valley a large pasture sloped down
to a [?] swamp in which the brook took its size.
The lower edge of this pasture had grown up to [?]umaco ([?]
