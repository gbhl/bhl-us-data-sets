1890.
Sept. 21;
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
  Clear and cool with light N.W. wind. A superb au-
tumn day.
  Spent the morning about the house unpacking etc. Henshaw
took a short walk and flushed a Woodcock near the lake
shore in front of the house.  He brought in some specimens
of Actra alba, the white fruit of their blood red stems
very striking.

  After dinner rowed over to the Lake House with H. Saw
three Wood Ducks, two of them drakes in apparently full
plumage. They were feeding near shore just east of Brown's
point: Opposite Peasley's spring saw a Solitary Sandpiper
standing on the edge of the water.

  Returned late in the afternoon seeing nothing of in-
terest on the way. The water is high but not over much
of the grass meadowland. Partridges are said to be very
scarce; no one has seen any Wild Pigeons this year.
Crocker is credited with having killed two Snipe yesterday
