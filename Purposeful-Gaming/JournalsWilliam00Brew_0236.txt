scaled past. The air was still and sultry. From
the reedy tangles along the river the cries of Coots
and Florida Gallinules were heard almost incessantly.
After lunch I landed an[d] beat the Snipe ground
starting five birds and killing all of them making
six Snipe to-day in six shots. Also shot two
Meadow Larks and a Florida Crow, the latter 
sitting on the top of a small pine. Started a
Short-billed Marsh Wren, several Titlarks & Sav. Sparrows.
  Returning to the boat we pushed off & had
just cleared the oaks when I saw a snake
swimming well out in the river. It proved to be
a diamond rattlesnake about two feet long with
only one rattle and a "button".
  On the way back followed the river to the
Lake. It is bordered by beds of floating vegetation
chiefly lily leaves and a large Polygonum with dense
and very tall reeds behind. These belts were alive
with Florida Gallinules which, as we approached,
scuttled, swam or flew back into the reeds. They
often walked on the lily leaves or stood erect on
them. Swimming they looked very like Coots. There
must have been thousands of them. Coots were
also numerous, scattered about in every direction
singly or in little clusters. I shot two Gallinules
& two Coots. Also shot a Boat-tail Grackle that
flew past the boat. The outcry of the Coots & Gallinules
was nearly incessant. Saw about sixty Duck, at
least fifty in one flock. Near the mouth of the
river about forty Herons rose at once, mostly A. caerulea
with a few A. ludoviciana. Red-wing Blackbirds swarming
in the reeds & very tame. Maryland Yellow-throats also
very numerous. Boat-tailed Grackle everywhere along
the river, nearly all of them females. A superb sunset.
