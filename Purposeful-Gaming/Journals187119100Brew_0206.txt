1886
Sept.5 Sunday.
Concord, Massachusetts.
  A still, rather sultry day, cloudy until late in P.M.
when the sky chard and the sun came out.
  In the morning took a long drive with Jeffries, through
the Estabrook road to Carlisle, theme to Nether bus Mills,
back to town by the Prison, and afterwards to and
around the little pond in Fairyland.
  Birds were not numerous and we saw nothing
of interst except a flock of about forty Swallows
and a Kingsbird, perched on a telegraph with just
east of the out-arch bridge on the Assabet. The
Swallows were chiefly H, horrounium with about ten
Cotila riparia and a high young Progene.
  Spent the afternoon up river with Jeffries and 
Purdie starting at 2:30 and going as far as
Fairhaven. We saw few small birds-almost 
none in fact-but Ducks were almost constantly in 
sight, the majority Wood Ducks, with a high Leaf
and one flock of seven  Black Ducks which passed
high overhead in the evening twilight as we were 
passing the town on our way home. Of Wood Ducks
we must have seen at least ten but as they 
were very tame and kept flying about and alighting
them seemed to be a great many more.
  As we were siting on Martha's Point a short
time before sunset a Great Horned Owl began
hooting in the woods on Lee's Cliff.  A few Swallows
also passed high overhead flying up river.
  A high Bittern was also seen as well as a 
Red-wing Blackbird the latter a solitary individual
going to roost in the reeds by the river. No birds
