1889
March 29
Tallahassee (Fla.) to Thomasville (Ga.)
  Early morning cool, almost frosty. Middle of day
very warm with light W[est] wind. Entire day cloudless.
  We left Tallahassee at 9.30 a.m. and drove to
Thomasville (Ga) reaching our destination at 5 p.m.
There was little change in the general character of
the country until we were within about a mile of
the state line when the hills melted gradually
away and a slightly uneven but nowhere broken
region succeeded, very monotonous, chiefly covered
with pine woods (the timber exceptionally heavy) with
occasional barren looking plantations and a few
cypress swamps. Red bud, buckeye, and a few
pink azalea (A. nudiflora) appeared just north of the state
line and were seen almost everywhere beyond but
the Cherokee roses, which throughout the hilly Tallahassee
region lined the roadsides with walls of snowy white
flowers, were few and scanty after the state line
was passed. I saw only one red bud (at Lake Hall) in
the Tallahassee region. Cornus florida was equally
common in both belts.
  Birds were abundant throughout the Tallahassee
region but scarce after we passed the state line.
In the flat pine region towards Thomasville I [saw]
three adult Ardea caerulea (and a white bird which
I took to be a young of the same species) about small
ponds, One Hylotomus and a pair of Black Vultures
sitting on a fence by the roadside. Hermit Thrushes
and White-throated Sparrows were the commonest
birds observed and both extended over the entire
distance traversed. Mocking birds were equally
numerous and ubiquitous. I heard two Regulus
