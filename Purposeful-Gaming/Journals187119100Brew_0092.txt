1886
June 21  
Concord, Massachusetts                  
  Clear and hot, wind S.W. light, at times
failing altogether.
  Of in my boat at 6.a.m. Paddled slowly
down through the meadows, stopping frequently
and going ashore in several places. Orioles, Cuckoos
(both species) Robins and Red-Wings resorting "[?]"
numbers to the white maples along the banks,
Some of the larger, denser-foliaged trees were liter-
ally alive with these birds, with also an occasional
Rose-Breasted Grosbeak, and not a few Song Sparrows.
In a single tree I repeatedly saw eight or ten
birds of these species. They were actively feeding,
hopping from twig to twig across the clusters of
leaves at the ends of the branches; the Cuckoos
performing this action clumsily, making a
distinctly audible rustle and shaking the ten-
der twigs violently as they moved. I saw both
Cuckoos and Orioles with large green worms
(Caterpillers) in their beaks and these were prob-
ably the attraction for all. The number of birds
diminished after the sun got well up in the heav-
ens but there were some at work all day.
 Passing close under Ball's Hill I was surprised
to hear the whining pipe of a Red-billed Nuthatcher
and a moment after I distinctly saw the bird
fly from a pine on the crest of the ridge and after
zig-zagging through the air for fifty yards or more
alight in another pine. I landed and climbed
to the spot to no purpose for the bird was either
gone or obstinately silent. An hour or more later
while exploring the fine old woods a mile below
where I shot the Blackburian Warbler on the 11th
