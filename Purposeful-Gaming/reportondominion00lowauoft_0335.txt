Coal, sandstone, clay-ironstone and brown hematite, were 
found along a line stretching e.n.e. from Baring island, 
through the south of Melville island, Byam-Martin island and 
the Whole of Bathurst island. Carboniferous limestones, with 
characteristic fossils, were found along the north coast of 
Bathurst island, and at Hillock point on Melville island. 
From the comparison of different coal exposures noted by 
m'clintock, M'Clure, Austin and Parry in the Parry islands, 
Professor Haughton has laid down the approximate outcrops of 
some of the coal beds. These he finds to agree remarkably Well 
with the trend of the boundary of the formation drawn from 
totally different data. Lists of fossils and rocks from the fol- 
lowing places, with notes, are given : ' Hillock point, Melville 
island (latitude 76 n., longitude 111 45' W.). Bathurst 
island, north coast, Cape Lady Franklin (latitude 76 40' n., 
longitude 98 45' W.). Princess-Royal island, Prince of Wales 
strait, Baring island (latitude 72 45' n., longitude 117 30' 
W.). In connection with this place it is noted that the Carbon- 
iferous sandstones underlie the limestones, and that it is 
probable that the coal beds of Melville island are very low down 
in the series, and do not correspond in geological position with 
the coal beds of Europe. Cape Hamilton, Baring island (lati- 
tude 74 15' n., longitude, 117 30' W.). Cape Dundas, Mel- 
ville island (latitude 74 30' N., longitude 111 45'). Cape 
Sir James Ross, Melville island (latitude 74 45' !N"., longitude 
114 30'). Cape Providence, Melville island (latitude 74 20' 
N., longitude 120 30' W.). Winter Harbour, Melville island 
(latitude 75 35' n., longitude 110 45' W.). Bridgeport 
inlet, Melville island (latitude 75 N., longitude 109 W.). 
Skene bay, Melville island (latitude 75 n., longitude 108 
W.). Hooper island, Lyddon gulf, Melville island (latitude 
75 10', longitude 112 W.). Byam-Martin island (latitude 
75 10' N., longitude 104 15' W.). Graham-Moore bay,
