1889
Oct. 21
Clear, very cold in the early morning, warm at noon. Wind shifting
into every quarter, light all day.
  Breakfast at 7 o'clock. Off at about 8 a.m. rowing up to the 
outlet and thence following the river (which has now resumed
well defined banks) to Richardson's Carry. Snow Buntings & 
Titlarks piping over the marshes. A Hooded Merganser flushed 
from the river. At moose Point a Buffle-head swimming close 
to the sunny side of the bank. Jim paddled me within
good shot (our boat was grassed) when I was foolish enough
to try to change guns & take the 20 gauge. The little Duck
saw the motion & rose when I missed with both barrels.
Next to Whale Back Cove. A Tringa alpina rose wild from 
the shore. A Black Duck swam out from the grass & 
rose. I fired a long shot vainly. Saw a flock of about a 
dozen Scoters flying towards Sunday Cove.

  Turned back and doubling Pine Point rowed down into
Glaspy Cove. Two Horned Greebes seen, each near shore. In 
the cove two Scoters apparently feeding close to the marsh. 
One dove. I shot the other & found it to be a young Butter-bill
apparently not a wounded bird. Hearing Grouse chitter we 
landed and I at once saw a magnificent drummer strutting
among the driftwood, his tail erect and spread like a fan.
Shot him when others began to chitter & stalk along among
the bushes. In less than five minutes I had killed six,
all sitting, in six shots. They were all we could find. Four
were [females] one a young [male]. I distinctly heard one of them utter
a low coo-coo-coo-coo-coo several times. A flock of about forty 
Snow Buntings alighted in the grass. Large flocks of 
Red-polls & White-winged Crossbills heard flying over. 
Returned to camp to dinner. Went out after Owls at sunset.
Heard two Great-Horned Owls hooting & saw a small Owl, 
perhaps a Short-eared, flying near Moll's Carry. Two Wilson's 
Snipe rose from the edge of Leonard's Pond in the twilight.
