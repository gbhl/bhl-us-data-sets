Sunday, June 16.
  Cloudy all day and a very
uncomfortable day on account
of the heat. Ther about 70 [degrees]���
84 [degrees]���72 [degrees]. Went to church
in A.M. with Dan but
suffered greatly on account
of the closeness of the air.
Spent most of the time before
dinner in reading and most
of the P.M. in the same
manner. Went up to the Russell's
with Dan, a short time before tea.
Carried my hawk from the
attic to the cellar. Spent the
evening on the piazza. The leaves
have all attained their full growth,
the canker worms have about finished
the apple trees, & the grass is as tall 
as it will be. Found a yl bll cuckoo's
in our yard with 3.
