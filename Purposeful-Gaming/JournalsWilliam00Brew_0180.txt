1888
(Oct. 27)
remained below. Finally the Grouse started and came
out past me over an open field. I missed with my
first but killed with the second barrel. Saw nothing
more at this place excepting a few Jays, Sparrows etc.
  Landed next about half a mile below Pantry Brook
and made a short search for a Hairy Woodpecker
which we heard calling in some oak woods. Failed
to find anything but some Jays.

  When we crossed Fairhaven it was beginning to
get dark but we landed opposite the Cliffs and
beat a weed field in the hope of finding the
Quail seen yesterday. In this we failed but I shot
a Shrike in an apple tree on the crest of a knoll.
It was a very brown specimen and, I think, the
same bird seen on the 26th near Martha's Point.
While at this place we saw three large flocks of
Rusty Blackbirds flying up river to the old time
roost in the button bushes at the Bay. There must
have been over a hundred birds in all.

  The remainder of our voyage was uneventful but
very pleasant despite the rain which poured down
merrily most of the time. At the Manse the trees
were dripping incessantly into the quiet river in
which the lights of the houses & bridges were reflected
on every side. It was one of those soft, peaceful
rainy nights peculiar to this season and very
good to be out in.
