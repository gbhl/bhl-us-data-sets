on the barren-ground caribou. The Aivilliks are scattered along 
the coast from Cape Fullerton to Repulse bay. These are the 
natives employed by the American Whalers to assist in the whal- 
ing industry, and who in consequence are more civilized than 
their neighbours north and south. From long contact with the 
Whalers, there is an admixture of white blood in this tribe, 
although half-breeds usually die young. The tribe has con- 
tracted some of the loathsome diseases of civilization. They at 
present number 138 persons, and the population now appears 
to be nearly stationary, though there was a considerable decrease 
for some years after the whaling vessels first frequented the bay 
and before the tribe became accustomed to the changes involved. 
The Iglulingmiut are a small tribe occupying the east shore 
of Fox channel, from Repulse bay northward to Fury and Hecla 
strait, and were the tribe met with and described by Parry, who 
wintered among them in 1821-22. According to Captain Comer 
they now number only sixty persons, and are not increasing. 
The Nechillingmiut are the most numerous tribe to the west- 
ward of Hudson bay, and number about 450 persons. They 
inhabit the country to the westward of the Igluliks and Aivil- 
liks, extending westward and northward to Back river and the 
shores and islands of the Arctic sea. The Sinimiut were a small 
independent tribe, living about the southern shores of Com- 
mittee bay, but they have now been absorbed into the Nechilliks. 
Another small inland tribe is the Shaunuktungmiut, who 
occupy territory to the southwest of Chesterfield inlet. Little 
is known about this people, except that they are a small tribe 
allied to the Kenipitumiut. 
Coming to the natives of baffin island, the nugumiut tribe 
inhabit the country about Frobisher bay, and at present have 
their headquarters at the whaling settlement at Cape Haven, 
being employed about the station, during the periods of open 
water, in chasing whales, walrus and seals. Their number is 
sufficient to man four whaleboats, requiring about twenty able-
