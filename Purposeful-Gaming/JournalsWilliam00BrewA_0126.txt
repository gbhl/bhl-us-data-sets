have been missing for eight or ten years.
  I searched long in the further swamp for the 
nest of the Rose-breasted Grosbeaks, both of which
clicked at me anxiously, but I found only two
or three Robins' nests which I did not examine and a 
Cat-birds' with three eggs.
  I next took the meadow to the north and searched 
it for the nest of a Carolina Rail which I have heard 
there several times this spring. In less than half an
hour I started the bird from a tussock nearly underfoot
and parting the grass looked in on a firm set of 12 eggs.
Took them but left the nest which I mean to get tussock
and all.
  Crossing the Fitchburg tracks I entered the meadow beyond.
A Carolina Rail calling èr-e and the cutta cry coming 
from the same spot. At first I thought one bird made
both sounds but afterwards there seemed to be two both in
a thicket of willows. Finally the èr-e came from a
cluster of tussocks out in the open meadow. I splashed in
and sent up a Carolina Rail. 
  On the old embankment which crosses this meadow I
saw a Virginia Rail. He came out into the path and 
seeing me made a long, swift run straight down the path. 
  In the larger meadow north of this embankment I
found another Carolina Rails' nest. It was in a tussock 
which was one of three growing close together & surrounded
by open water. Bird slipped off ten feet ahead and
swam across the open water carrying her tail pointing
straight up. Thirteen eggs.
  Having all my boxes filled to overflowing I started
for home, walking all the way. A glowing sunset, the 
evening cool and still many birds singing. Enjoyed this 
walk exceedingly.
