& with Mr. Davenport
took down the Deacons
boat to the musk rat
pond back of Mt. Auburn
& reaching the island
found one Carolina Rail's
nest building & another
containing two eggs.
Got also some Red Wings

Got back in time for

over to see Mr. Barnes again.
In evening went
down to the pond & took a row.

  Cloudy. Began to rain
in the afternoon and
rained hard all night.
Ther. about 70[degrees] - 75[degrees] - 
70[degrees]. Rose as usual.
Rode down to school but
got late. Walked up
as far as the old place
coming up & rode the rest
of the way. Read Homer
all the P.M. getting
about 115 lines. Went
over to Mr. Davenport's
in the evening & made
a skin of my Finch shot
yesterday while he skinned
a Cuckoo. Father con-
tinues about the same
and does not sit up
at all as yet.
The oaks are about
the only trees that have
not got their full foliage.
