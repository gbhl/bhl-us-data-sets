196 CRUISE OF the NEPTUNE 
The granite-gneisses are also most abundant inland, as was 
seen along the lower part of Chesterfield inlet and in the 
country forty miles inland from Winchester inlet 
The granites occupy the shores and islands between Win- 
chester inlet and the west side of Island bay, about half way to 
Fullerton, when they give place abruptly to a series of dark 
schists. These schists are largely micaceous, but there are also 
frequent bands containing considerable quantities of horn- 
blende, and these are more basic than the more .common mica- 
schists, which always contain quartz in varying amounts. These 
mica-schists appear to have been clastic rocks associated with 
bands of trap, all having been altered and foliated by the granite 
intrusion. The schists are very regular, and have a constant 
strike of n. 10 W. Many of the basic bands contain varying 
quantities of pyrite, but it was never seen in sufficient abund- 
ance to constitute a mine. All the schists carry dark-red 
garnets, some of which are regular in their crystallization and 
of good size. 
The islands about Fullerton harbour are formed partly of 
granite and partly of these dark schists. On this eastern 
contact of the granite with the area of schistose rocks, the latter 
have been greatly disturbed by the intrusion, being squeezed, 
contorted and broken by granite masses, as may be seen from 
the illustration. Areas of coarser basic rocks now occur in the 
rocks along the coast, usually in the form of coarse gabbro, but 
often in a more altered condition as coarse hornblende-gneisses. 
The granites are the prevailing rocks along the coast as far 
north as the mouth of Wager inlet, and have generally a red or 
pink colour. Associated with them and evidently altered by 
their intrusion .are patches of gray quartzose gneiss, and less 
frequently areas of old basic intrusive rocks. 
At Whale point, where the rocks were closely examined, the 
oldest rock was represented by a medium to fine-grained, gray
