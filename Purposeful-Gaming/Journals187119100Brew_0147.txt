(July 28)
early twilight an Owl (Bobo [?]) hooted
several times in the distance towards Walden and 
later still a a Whippoorwill began in the woods on
Martha's Point. Besides this we heard a Tanager
and one or two Field Sparrows Singing.

  The sunset was a failure although it had promised
well, the sun merely drinking into a sultry mass of 
clouds without thinking any of them. The air was
also heavy and the distant views obscured. 
  At about 8 P.M. we started back sailing before 
a light but steady S. L breeze to the Fitchburg R. R.
bridge. The night was clear, soft and damp. 
The only sounds along the river were the splashing of frogs
and muskrats and the sharpie splash of jumping
fishes. The green frog still tangs. Heard only one bull frog.

  Overheard Warblers were migrating in considerable
numbers. I heard at least twenty in the course
of an hour. They are the first that I have heard
this summer and were probably largely D. aestiver.
I am only near that many of the Swallows have
left within the past week.
