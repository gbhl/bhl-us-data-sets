to the extreme outer berth but gained nothing
by this for the birds at first kept still further 
out and then began to pass inside of all
the boats. Late in the morning I returned 
to my first station but the flight was about
over and I got only one more Duck there.
  There was a heavy ground swell running all
the morning but the wind was light. The birds 
nearly all hugged the Newport shore closely and
kept up well into the mouth of[?] River
then bore down directly towards us in a straight
course for the end of West Island. Some one i
the line of boats was nearly sure so see them
long before they reached us and as soon as word
was passed every man lay down in his boat.
The long line of dark specks approached with wonderful
speed and as quickly passed out of sight to the
eastward. At least nine-tenths of the flocks got by
without receiving a shot from any one.It was 
first hope, then doubt, finally disappointment in
the vast majority of cases but the interest was
well kept up.
  Mackay and I left the island at 1 P.M. and 
drove to[?] in time to get the 3.20 train 
for Boston. M. saw Cow-birds, Meadow Larks,
Red-wings, Grass Finches and Savanna & Song
Sparrows along the road. Also a single Osprey
and a few Blue birds.
