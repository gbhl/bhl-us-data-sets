THE REFLEX ARC 267 
axiation of the cortex as a Whole is absent or practically 
absent, although a very definite surface-interior pattern 
does exist. The dominant region of the cortex may 
therefore shift from moment to moment and is purely 
physiological and transitory rather than morphologically 
persistent. That there is anything essentially new in 
these suggestions I should be the last to claim. They 
are brought forward here merely as the final point in the 
discussion of functional direction in relation to the physio- 
logical gradients.
