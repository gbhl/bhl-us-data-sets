FIELD WORK AND TRAVELS 
Mr. Troughton had travelled widely, always with the interests of the 
Australian Museum at heart. For example, during a brief stop at Canton Island, 
when being flown across the Pacific, he collected a shark for me. He had no 
preservatives, so informed a Customs official in Sydney that if he held the shark 
much longer, it would "declare" itself! 
He had Visited China, flown over the Burma Hump, and had had several 
trips to England, Europe and the United States, also Visiting Japan and Antarctica. 
An argumentative old bushman, debating with him about the mode of reproduction 
of kangaroos, once scornfully referred to Troughton as a "Pitt and George Street 
naturalist". Nothing could have been further from the truth, for Troughton spent 
considerable periods in the bush, in many parts of Australia remote from those 
Sydney thoroughfares, and he also collected in the Santa Cruz Islands, New 
Guinea, the Moluccas and elsewhere. He preserved not only mammals but birds, 
fishes, insects, etc., for the Australian Museum. 
His more important collecting localities, roughly in chronological order, were 
as follows. 
His first field trip in 1912 at the age of 19 was to the Capricorn Group, 
Queensland, with A. R. McCulloch and Professor Thomas Harvey Johnston. The 
period from December 1919 to April 1920 was spent in South Australia (Farina, 
Eyre's Peninsula and Kangaroo Island) with C. M. Hoy, a representative of the 
United States National Museum, Washington. Troughton then secured 1,416 
specimens for the Australian Museum at a total cost of £74. In 1920 and 1921, 
he collected at the Myall Lakes, Blue Mountains and the Nepean River, New 
South Wales, and made one of what was to be many trips to Lord Howe Island. 
From October to December 1921, with J. H. Wright as assistant, Troughton 
collected at several stations along the Trans-Australian Railway,across the Nullarbor 
Plain to south-western Australia, securing over 1,000 specimens for a total cost 
of £105. A long series of bats was collected at Hunter's Hill, near Sydney, in 
1926. Later that year (July-August 1926), he visited Vanikoro and other islands 
of the Santa Cruz Group with A. A. Livingstone; these places were important 
as being the type-locality of some of Quoy and Gaimard's species. Good collections 
of marine life and ethnographical material were made at the same time, so that the 
Museum received rich stores of mammals (notably bats), birds, reptiles, fishes, 
shells, corals and insects. 
In 1931, Troughton visited the National Park and Minnamurra, New South 
Wales, with A. J. Marshall. In 1934, at his own expense, he visited remote parts
