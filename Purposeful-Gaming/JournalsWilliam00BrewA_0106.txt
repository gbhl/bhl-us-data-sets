the bright sky in the west as they crossed the
open meadow going towards Pout Pond. A
moment later another started and turning 
came directly over us. I am very sure
it was a drake. It followed the others and
doubtless also went to Pout Pond.
  As twilight deepened, the Swamp Sparrows
sang freely on all sides in spite of the cold
wind. One mounted into the air near us
and sang on wing.
  When it was nearly dark we started back.
As we were pushing our way through a
thicket we started a Veery who uttered his
[phew?] within a few yards of us.
Nearing Pout Pond we heard a perfect medley
of Rail voices, all Carolinas and all singing
ka-e. There were four singing at once in 
the Pout Pond swamp and at least three
others on the open meadows to the north.
All sang steadily but the notes of most of
them lacked the full reedy tone heard later
in the season. We started a Wood Duck
near the outlet of the pond hearing its
o'-ank distinctly a number of times but
failing to see it in the gloom.
  Walking down the Fitchburg tracks we heard
a Carolina Rail in the meadow just north
of Glacialis but nearer to the eastward of this.
  Hyla pickeringii in full chorus to-night
all over the meadows. No other frog
voices and no toads.
