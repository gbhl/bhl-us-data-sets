1886
July 14
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Cloudy, with fine mist-like rain at times. Wind. E.
  Started up run by boat at 9 A.M. with 
Messr. Edward Hoar, D.C French, and Walter Dean.
Spent the day about Fairhaven botanizing
most of the time. Mr. Hoar says that the black
ash which I found on the 11th at Martha's Point
is the only one he knows here. He took us to 
Thoreau's slippery elm on Lee's Cliff. It is a 
low but evidently old true compound of a rural
trunks separate to the ground but evidently
coming from the same roots. The trunks have
been cruelly reared and mutilated by back
gatherers.

  A Turtle Dove was cooing at regular intervals
in the prairies opposite the Cliff's as one passed on 
our way up ruin and in the pasture at an 
base of the the Cliffs on one return. It is the first 
I over heard in Massachusetts.

  At Martha's Point Mr. Hoar flushed a 
Woodcock from the open meadow bordering the 
river; baring numerous in the springy ground
over several rods.

  While one was eating brush at the base 
of Lee's Cliff a Red-Tailed Hawk appeared sailing
majestically high above the woods screaming
incessantly. It was pursued by two King bird
but ignored them as usual.

  The lilies were in wonderful profusion as 
we passed up river leaving the margin like a 
broad band of row. We picked some from pink
ours under the Cliff.
