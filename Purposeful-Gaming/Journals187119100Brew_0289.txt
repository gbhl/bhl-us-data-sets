several  Black-poll Warblers.
  Returning to the canoe I paddled a little further
down where just below the hill I saw a pair of
Turtle Doves a light in the grass near the bank. Rumming
the boat quietly until it grounded I rose cautiously
and after watching a moment sped the head and 
week of a Dove among the grass. The distance was fully
20 yds. and I had only the litter 32 cal. pistol and dust
shot but I took the chances and fired. My bird
fluttering about madly, evidently shot through the head,
the other not viable. Landing I found both Dove
lying within a foot of one another, the male dead the female
dying. It was an amazing piece of luck for they 
are among the toughest of all birds.

  Had a delightful if unexciting sail home hardly
dipping the paddle all the way to the Manse. Birds
singing freely especially Red-wings and Bobolinks both
now well up to last years numbers. Where are the 
Swallows? Saw only two Barn's, three or four Martins, not 
over six White-bellies and no Eaves. Bank Swallows in
larger numbers than last year, however, King birds very
scarce. Did not see more than three and four in all to day
Orioles more numerous than last year.

  Bittern bushes leaping out to-day. White maples
dense with foliage. The oaks covered with catkins
and small purplish-red leaves.
 Few mosquitos as yet. No black flies in the
woods on Ball's Hill.
  Heard a Bittern, and a Carolina Rail and saw an
miniature Buteo borealis.
  Early this morning I heard what I was here was a 
Carolina Vireo. Dressing hurriedly I rushed out and found 
it an Oriole, a new comer with a song exactly like the [?]
