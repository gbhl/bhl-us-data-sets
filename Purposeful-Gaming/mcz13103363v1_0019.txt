mixed with slate above
and dirty white beneath,
they are not strictly speaking
Golden crowned or crested,
but possess a stripe which
runs fro the top of the
head down to the neck, this stripe is composed
of orange in the middle
and yellow on the sides
their note is much like 
that of a creper but
is alittle longer. (I have
since shot a female and I
find that the whole middle
part of the top of the head is yellow.)
  March 2nd, 1865.
  I saw a large flock of 
Blue Jays and after 
chasing them some distance
shot one which is now
in my collection;(I
should have shot
another but the gun
[?] fire and disconcerted
my aim)
  Blue Bird

  Heard one, but so
plainly and for so long a
time as to leave no doubt
