SEROUS GLANDS OF THE VALLATE PAPILLAE 371 
this papilla is only 0.5 mm. and the lateral diameter 0.56 mm., 
one can readily see that there must be great intermingling of 
glands when there are thirty or forty such ducts, or one hundred 
as was found in a younger specimen (19 cm.). 
A graphic reconstruction from the newborn to show the posi- 
tion of the papillae and the distribution of the serous glands 
resembles in all respects the reconstruction of Oppel ('99). 
Since the glands of the newborn are not of the branched, 
tubular type of the child of fourteen years as modeled and de- 
scribed by Maziarski, reconstructions of glands from specimens

of intermediate ages were made in order to determine the char- 
acter of the transition between these forms. From a reconstruc- 
tion of a small group of glands of a nine months old child it 
appears that these resemble closely those of the newborn (fig. 8). 
The alveolar masses occasionally anastomose although this may 
not be apparent from a surface View. As stated above the 
method of development readily accounts for this anastomosing 
of end-pieces. In the newborn and nine months old child, the 
larger ducts frequently present small irregular outpouchings 
connected by short, constricted stalks. Some of these show the 
beginnings of secondary alveolar-like sacs. These groups may 
develop into glands similar to those already formed, or remain 
in a more or less undeveloped state.
