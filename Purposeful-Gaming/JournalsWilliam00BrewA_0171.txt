Falmouth, Massachusetts
  Clear with rather heavy shower at 2 PM. Afternoon still and 
very warm.
  Spent the morning writing. At 2.30 PM started off with 
C. driving first to Falmouth Heights. As we were passing
over a causeway where a creek empties into the sea I heard
what I took to be a Sharp-tailed Finch sing [?over]. Stopped
and listened but it was not repeated. A pair of Wilson's 
Terns came in from the sea and flew low over our heads
going up the creek which broadened into a pond higher up. 
  Beyond the Heights we game to another similar but much
larger pond (perhaps 3/4 mile long by 1/8 mile wide), also connected
with the sea by a creek a few feet wide, evidently shallow
over most of its extent, surrounded by woods at its upper end, 
and bordered at its lower end by a narrow strip of marsh.
The general appearance of the [?mud?sand] etc about the shores of
this pond sugggested that of the salt ponds in our marshes
and the several kinds of grasses in the marsh were all
certainly salt marsh species but on tasting the water in the
pond near its outlet I found it perfectly fresh. Doubtless, 
however, it is affected more or less by the higher tides, 
which must flow into the pond as the creek is less than 100
yards in length and has only a trifling fall.
  This pond seemed to be a chosen fishing ground for
the Wilson's Terns six or eight of which were constantly 
flying or hovering over it their numbers varying as they 
came and went to and from the sea. There were no
Roseates and, as nearly as I could make out with 
my glass, no Arctic Terns among them. 
  After watching the Terms awhile I entered the marsh
to look for Sharp-tailed Finches. Within less than ten
minutes and in going not over 200 yds following a narrow
