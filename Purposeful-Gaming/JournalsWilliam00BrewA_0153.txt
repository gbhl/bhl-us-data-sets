Wayland and Sudbury, Mass.
Trip to Wayside Inn
Cloudless but slightly hazy; warm with S. W. wind.
  Drove to Waverley this morning when I took 7.37 train for 
Haylared? with Faxon.  On reaching our destination we hired a horse [Right hand margin] colony of
and buggy and started off along the  road to the lower bridge. At          [Right hand margin] Eaves Swallows 
the last house before reaching the river we stopped to examine the
large colony of Eaves Swallows of which Faxon has told us? counted
90 nests on one side of barn, 25 on other. Thru ? House Sparrows hanging
about alighting on the eaves first the nests. The farmer says
he has seen them pull their young from a nest &[and] kill them.  I shot a â™€[female]
sparrow on the barn, at his request.
 Crossed the river & visited the smaller colony.  Several birds in road 
getting mud. No new nests. A quail whistling near the house doubling 
the bob-white sometimes.  Listened in vain for the orchard Oriole[?]
 Continued by road to the big pines. Found them all gone, an
unsightly wood lot & stumps marked where the noble trees stood in 1887.
The large maples & oaks opposite still standing & a Buteo lineatus
screaming over them. 
 Next to the Wayside Inn by devious, winding, many branching 
roads. Parula singing in maple swamp - a few shreds of Usnea on trees.
A Carolina Dove darting overhead through the pines.
 Lunched under an elm in front of the "Inn", a varied, picturesque [Right hand margin] Birds at
country around us. Very many birds here. Six Chimney Swifts careering
about the house. A pair of White-bellied Swallows feeding young in a hole
under the eaves.  A Thrasher in full song behind the barn, a Warbling Vireo 
in elms, a Yellow-throated  ???? in oaks in pasture, a Red-wing by the bank?
Three White-bellied Nuthatches together in the old orchard. 
[margin] White pine?
[/margin] swamp
  After lunch down to an extension woods (near the Wayside Station).
chiefly a pine swamp, the trees tall and full of sphagnum and            
luxuriant ferns covering the moist ground.  A few hardwoods and 
hemlocks mixed with the pines. Land rising on west side to a 
knoll covered with smaller pines.  here we found several
