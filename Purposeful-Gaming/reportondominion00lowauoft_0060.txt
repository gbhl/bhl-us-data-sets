20 CRUISE OF THE NEPTUNE 
grounding, when beyond the sight of the low shores. The 
proximity to the magnetic pole accounts for the sluggishness 
of the compass in these waters, where no reliance can be placed 
on it. This, with the uncharted, low coast, bare of prominent 
landmarks, renders the approach to any of the harbours uncer- 
tain and dangerous. 
Inland from the shores the country rises slowly; indeed, the 
general elevation does not increase towards the interior above 
ten feet a mile, while along the shores there are no hills more 
than fifty feet high. 
Our instructions were to find, and, if possible, to pass, the 
winter in company with the American whaling ship known to 
be in Hudson bay. The Whalers formerly wintered at Marble 
island, or at Depot island; the former is to the southward of the 
mouth of Chesterfield inlet, the latter close to the entrance of 
Winchester inlet. Marble island has long been abandoned, 
chiefly on account of its insufficient water supply. Within the 
last few years a more convenient harbour was found close to 
Cape Fullerton, and the large launch was fitted out to search 
for it, the era not being in the harbour at Depot island. 
A strong gale lasted from the 18th to the 22nd, and we were 
very lucky to be in such a good harbour. While awaiting 
an abatement of the gale, several Eskimos came overland to the 
ship, and were taken aboard. They were from Cape Fullerton, 
and were going inland from Winchester inlet to kill barren- 
ground caribou for their winter clothing. They had seen the 
ship as she passed, but could not reach us with their whaleboats 
owing to the gale. We learned from them that the Era was 
already in winter quarters at Fullerton. This information 
rendered the proposed trip in the launch useless, and it was 
therefore determined to send her up Chesterfield inlet, as the 
only place where a sufficient supply of deerskins for our winter 
clothing could be procured from the natives. The services of
