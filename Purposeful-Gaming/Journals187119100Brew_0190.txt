1886
Aug. 24
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and warm (Ther. 82[degrees] at noon) with strong S.W. wind.
  Spent the day down river starting at 10 A.M.
Sailed all the way from the Mause to the meadow

proved worthless as a specimen its throat being 
entirely bare.

  Three Red-Tailed Hawks were sailing in company 
over Ball's Hill breasting the strong wind. At the '

in sight on the opposite side of the river flapping

  Upon reaching the great woods I found the
mixed flock in the scrub on the south slope
Its numbers were reduced fully 75 per cent. In fact
besides Chickadees and Red-eyes it contained only
two Deudrocia pines, two D. pennsylvania, one Heil.
ureficaphila, two Litta Canadeusis, one Vireo flavifrous,
and two Picus pubiseus.  There was also Lanager 
in green plumage.
  At least one of the Gos-hawk family was
at home. I heard him squeaking when I first
entered the woods and while I was eating lunch
he came up behind us and alighted in a pine
not 40 yds. away.  Before I could get a sight
at him he flew giving me a very good cross
shot but I missed him (I used my 12 g. gun
that day).

  The return trip up river last in the 
afternoon was, as usual, very interesting and 
delightful. I saw about 50 Bobolinks, nearly as
