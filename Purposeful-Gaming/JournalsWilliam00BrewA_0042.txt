plumage matches closely in color. Under several
of the palms the ground was white with their
droppings.
  Of small birds I saw in this hamack a Blue Jay,
a Cat Bird, several Cardinals and [??} and 
perhaps a dozen [??] - absolutely nothing 
else.
  We next rowed nearly to #70 and turning
into a creek took a short cut for the stand 
where I shot yesterday. A pair of Florida Ducks, 
about 30 Shovelers, a few Yellow-throats & Swamp 
Sparrows, three Phebees and some Swamp Sparrows
seen along this creek. Prairie Warblers singing
on all sides in the mangroves.
  Reached my stand about noon and sat in
it until nearly sunset. Fired about forty shots 
bagging [15] Scaups, a [female symbol] Gadwal, a [female symbol] Ring-neck
and a [male? symbol] Ruddy. Lost about six wing-broken
birds. Made one clean double shot at Scaups. 
On the whole shot rather poorly missing a
number of fair shots. Late in the afternoon
all the Ducks came down wind going past
at tremendous speed. Several Shovelers & Gadwals &
a pair of Pintails passed. A thousand or more
Bald-pates passed over high in air. An
osprey passed. Brown Pelicans in sight
almost constantly. One came over me within
ten feet making a sawing noise by his violent
wing strokes after he discovered me. Several
alighted on the water near me.
  On the way home at sunset saw fully
100 Louisiana & Blue-Herons (caerulia) going to 
roost in some mangroves back 200 yds from the shore
