1886         
June 29
Concord, Massachusetts.
Clear with violent gusty W. wind.
  Starting at 9 a.m. I spent most of
the day on the river sailing down to      
Carlile bridge and back to Ball's Hill,    
rowing the remainder of the way home.
On the way down I did not get a
specimens of any kind.  Coming back
I landed at Ball's Hill and took lunch
there.  On the hill I got several birds,
among them three C.Virens. My own
Bird had built a second nest within
a few rods of the first and was to-day
sitting on four fresh eggs which I took
with the nest.

  At the first bend above the hill
I fired four or five shots at Bank
Swallows with my 32 cal. pistol, killing
two, one of which fell in the tall grass
(Phalaris arundinacea) and could not be
found.
  Near the "tent," I landed and searched
for young Bobolinks flushing two &
killing one flying. I also shot two
Barn Swallows here at they were skimming
over the meadow and a third sitting
on a dead branch.  All this was
done with my little 32 cal. pistol and
is by far the best shooting I have
ever made with it.
  Several broods of young Swallows out
sitting on dead branches over the water.
