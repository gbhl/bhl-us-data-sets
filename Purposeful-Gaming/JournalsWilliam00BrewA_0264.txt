1890
Oct. 9
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Fair with occasional sunshine. Moderate N. to N.W. wind.
  Left all the men at camp to get in wood & with 
M. spent the entire day hunting Snipe of which
we started 20 & killed 9, M.5 and I 4. We found
nine on the marsh opposite Leonard's Pond, three
nearer the Outlet, and eight in the pond. They 
lay very well to-day and were in the grass all
the snow having melted. Don made a beautiful
point on one of them which I saw squatting in
an opening on a smooth mossy place.

  We saw a Pigeon Hawk but not a single Duck
until just at night when two small flocks
of Black Ducks and one single bird came over
the marsh.

  There were no Robins to-day and no Rusty Blackbirds
of which we saw a number yesterday. Three Song
Sparrows & a Flicker were all the small birds
seen in Leonard's Pond. On the marsh started
a few Savanna & Swamp Sparrow.

  There were several Hermit Thrushes about the 
camp this morning & I heard a crow cawing.
Yesterday we saw a Great Blue Heron & to-day
a Kingfisher but bird life on the whole is at
very low ebb here now. A native killed a young
Semipalmated Plover in Moll's Carry to-day &
left it at camp for me.
