March 1
Charleston S.C. to Sanford, Florida
Cloudy with steady rain all day clearing at sunset
and becoming cooler.
  Left Charleston at 8:10 a.m. and went through
to Sanford by rail reaching the latter place
at 9 P.M. Saw very few birds by the way, a
Kingfisher, two or three flocks of Strunella, one
large flock of Doves, a few crows and only two
Buzzard both C. auras.
  Near Savannah the woods were in half leaf 
and even the cypresses covered with young foliage.
South of Jacksonville all the deciduous trees 
were in full or nearly full leaf and the 
woods as densely shady as in midsummer.
Near Jacksonville I saw sand lilies, a pink
azalea, and blue flag in bloom. There was
also a tall shrub covered with small white flowers,
the foliage apparently evergreen. This was abundant
in swamps everywhere between Savannah and
Jacksonville as well as to the south of the 
latter place. I remember seeing it last year
at about this time.

Mar. 2
Sanford, Florida
Clear and cold with a high N.W. wind. [Ther,?] 42[degrees] at
sunrise. Morning spent about the Sanford House
as there are no steamers to Enterprise to-day and
the lake is covered with white caps and [much?]
too rough to cross in a small boat. The cold
strong wind has driven most of the birds to
cover but I saw a Shrike and a few Florida
Grackles in the garden. No Boat-tails in the
palmettos along the lake shore probably because
