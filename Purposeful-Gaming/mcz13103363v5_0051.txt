Saturday, April 3, 1869
  Morning broke cloudy &
raining hard. Cleared off
at about 8 A.M. Set my
clock for 5.30 A.M. but as
it was raining hard I did
not go. After breakfast
had Tiger harnessed and
taking both dogs rode up
to Sherman's pond, which
was entirely open. Then rode
down through Belmont.
Billy pointed a Woodcock
which I did not care to shoot.
Shot a Red Wing. Got back
at 2 P.M. In the P.M. began
on the Woodcock shot yesterday
when E. Dodge & R. Deane
called and took up my time
for the rest of the P.M. Finished
the Woodcock in the evening.
Tyannis Fuscus, saw one,
the first here. Our house is
now as high as it is going
R. D. saw Dendroica Palmarum.
