1988
Sept 6   
Lake Umbagog, Maine
Clear & cool with high N. wind. Water froze last night.
  Spent the entire day hunting Woodcock with                             
Mr. Lovejoy. In the morning drove to the                                      
Pearly White farm and after spending fully                                   
hours then came away without a single
bird. We started only one Woodcock, in brakes
among spruces. We each shot once at him.

  On the way back we tried the Sargent
farm cover and L. shot the Woodcock I
left there yesterday. Don made a very                                    
fine point on this bird.
  In the afternoon we beat the alders 
behind Morse's on Upton Hill. Found only
one Woodcock which Don pointed three
times.  L. shot twice at this bird but
missed both times.                                                          
  In alders I saw two Black-billed Cuckoos                                     
one on the White farm, the other one Upton                                  
hill. One was silent, the other attracted my
attention by a low gutteral worrrooo which
he uttered many times in succession.
