1887
Sept. 22
MAINE, (L. Umbagog.)
Cloudy and cold with high N.W. wind.
  Starting at 9 a.m. I sailed down to the Lake House where
Duncan Sargent was waiting for me by appointment.

  Our objective point was the Cambridge River where we 
spent the entire day, going up to above the upper end 
of B. meadows.
  For some distance we saw nothing but a Kingfisher 
or two and heard almost no small birds in the 
wind - tossed woods. But on reaching the bend where 
I shot my second Black Duck on the 20th we came 
suddenly on a superb [male] Wood Duck. He was sitting on 
the water near the middle of the stream, side towards 
me, neck stretched up, crest raised and and all his 
brilliant coloring, especially the painted bill, showing 
plainly against the dark background. He rose almost 
as soon as I discover him, springing at least 
four feet into the air before using his wings. I had 
little more than a snap shot but my aim must 
have been correct for the charge cut out a lot of 
feathers from his sides. It failed to stop him 
however and we never saw him again. It was 
a bitter disappointment for I wanted him badly 
for a specimen.

  We lunched at the forks and then pushed on 
into the meadows paddling their entire length 
without seeing a living thing save a Heron and 
two Rusty Blackbirds. Shortly after entering the green 
woods, however, we came suddenly on a flock of 
four or five Black Ducks. I saw the wake of one among 
the alders then the Duck itself. She rose at once & 
I knocked her over. At the report two or three more 
started our coming down stream directly towards
