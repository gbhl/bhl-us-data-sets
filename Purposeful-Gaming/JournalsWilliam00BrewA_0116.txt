Cambridge, Massachusetts
and examine one nest. It was built in the fork of
a leaning alder only about 4 ft. above the water and
contained two eggs. There were about six pairs of
birds in this place & doubtless three or four more
nests.
  After shooting eight or nine birds in the Maple
Swamp I entered the North Meadow and visited the
three Swamp Sparrows' nests left on the 13th. One had
been robbed, one held four eggs, the third had a 
Song Sparrow in possession. I saw a Swamp Sparrow
near the latter on the 13th & the nest was typical 
in position & construction but the eggs, at the time,
looked to me like Song Sparrow's & I left them for
further proof of identity. I left the set of four
Swamp's to-day because they were not peculiar
in any way but took a new nest with a set of
five beautifully marked eggs in the meadow north
of the Fitchburg.
  In this meadow I heard a Carolina and
two Virginia Rails. This encouraged me to look
for Rails' nests generally & Virginia Rail's in particular
but I could find none although I spent an 
hour or more and searched every likely place.
  The red maples in these swamps are very
backward for the season. In no place to-day
did they cast any perceptable shade and
their leaves are as yet not much larger than
the proverbial Mouse's ears.
  A few Swallows of three species ([?], bicolor et
riparia) flying over the meadows but no Swifts 
seen. Found a Redstart's nest nearly finished &
a Song Sparrow's with half fledged young. Drove back
in time for dinner at 1 P.M.
