pointed Forest Ranger for that island. It is a pleasure to be 
able to take this advance step toward the better administration of 
our forest reserves. Ranger Lovell's work will consist chiefly 
in constructing fences at first, to be followed by the prevention of 
trespass and some planting work. He will continually be on the 
watch for forest fires. 
APPLICATION FOR AWA. 
An application was received during the month for permission 
to take awa from the unsurveyed government land mauka of the 
homesteads between Pahoa and Kaimu, District of Puna, Hawaii. 
On account of the absence of reliable precedent in handling such 
a permit, before referring the application to the Board I prefer 
first to investigate the matter on the ground in order to determine 
the value of the material to the government and the feasibility of 
issuing and handling such a permit. 
A report on the activities in the department of the Forest Nur- 
seryman is, as usual, appended to this report. 
Respectfully submitted, 
C. S. JUDD, 
Superintendent of Forestry. 
REPORT FOR MAY. 
Honolulu, June 10, 1915. 
Board of Commissioners of Agriculture and Forestry. 
Gentlemen : - I respectfully submit the following routine report 
for the Division of Forestry for the month of May, 1915: . 
FENCING ON KAUAI. 
The construction of the proposed 3.5 miles of fencing along 
the reserve boundary at Anahola, Kauai, mentioned in my April 
report, has not yet been started because as yet it has not been 
possible to secure the services of a local surveyor to run out 
two lines along the boundary of government land. These lines 
must be definitely located before the fence can be constructed and 
the building of the remainder of the fence would not be effective 
unless this gap is also fenced. I am in correspondence with par- 
ties who can do this surveying and hope soon to have it completed 
so that the fence construction can prOceed. -
