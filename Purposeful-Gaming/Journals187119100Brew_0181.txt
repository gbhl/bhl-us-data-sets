the under sides of the leaves and as I
brushed through the branches dropped on us
by the hundreds crawling up my arms & back
to my neck where the irritation produced by
their pressure was exceedingly annoying.
  Saw two large black snakes both of which
fled at my approach with their usual swiftness.
  Only one chipmunk to-day and none
yesterday. Where can they be?
  No birds singing to-day, or at least none
in full song. A Field Sparrow trilled in dry
feeble tones and a Red-eye warbled faintly,
nothing more.
