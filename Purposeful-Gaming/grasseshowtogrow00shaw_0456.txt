424 GRASSES AND HOW TO GROW THEM. 
the third day. The length of time that the hay should 
remain in the cocks will depend chiefly on the weather, 
but usually it remains thus for two or three days. 
While in the cocks, it ^ ^sweats'' more or less which means 
that it ferments slightly and, as a result, is less liable 
to ferment excessively in the mow. No time should 
be lost in storing hay as soon as it is ready. 
This may be determined by taking a wisp of hay 
from within the heap and twisting it in the hands. 
If no moisture exudes, the hay is ready to store. An- 
other method of judging is by the comparative weight 
of the hay in being handled, which can be easily judged 
by a skilled hand. Before drawing the hay for storage, 
it is usual to spread out the cocks, more or less, for ex- 
posure to the sunlight for a few hours, before drawing 
them and more especially the parts of the same near- 
est to the ground. This should not be done much in 
advance of the storing, in showery weather. 
Cow peas and soy beans are frequently left longer on 
the ground, before putting them up in cocks, especially 
the former, since they cure but slowly. The cocks are 
made small and narrow in proportion to the height to 
facilitate drying out. They too are frequently turned 
over, more or less, before they are drawn, to secure in 
them quicker and more thorough drying. In some in- 
stances, they are stacked soon after being cut. The 
procedure is, in substance, as follows : Poles are plant- 
ed in the ground to the height of about 9 feet and one 
foot into the ground. One pair of strips of wood is 
fastened to the stack pole at right angles to each other 
and one foot from the ground. These are laden with
