It will be seen in Table XI that the average ratios of the 
two leper series far exceeds that of any sputum series; in fact, 
that of A, Table X, the lowest of the two leper series, is nearly 
double the highest of the other series. 
The average number of days of survival of the leper series 
is much below that of any sputum series; but by comparing in- 
dividual ratios in all tables with the corresponding number of 
days of survival, it does not appear that there is any constant 
correlation between the time of survival and the enlargement of 
the spleen. The evidence is good that we have to do with a 
strain of tuberculosis which in guinea pigs tends to enlarge the 
spleen to a greater degree than occurred in the other series of 
animals inoculated with the mixed strains from sputum. In 
calculating the average number of days of survival in Table VII, 
only those animals are included of which the spleen weight was 
known. 
SERIES B 
Spleen pulp from a human case of leprosy, taken at post 
mortem, was inoculated August 5, 1912, into four guinea pigs 
subcutaneously. The leprosy case was well advanced and showed 
numerous lepra bacilli in the spleen pulp and glands. Two of 
the four guinea pigs developed tubercles in the inguinal region 
in less than forty days after inoculation, while the other two 
showed no signs of infection after having been kept under ob- 
servation over one and one-half years. One, 6349, died No- 
vember 7, 1913, about one year and three months after inocula- 
tion, with numerous tubercles in the spleen, liver, and lungs, and 
enormous numbers of acid-fast bacilli in the liver. The spleen 
weight was 2.1 grams; its ratio to body weight, 0.0051. A 
portion of the spleen pulp of 6347 was inoculated into a new 
guinea pig, 6816. This guinea pig died two hundred twelve days 
after inoculation, showing tubercles in spleen, liver, and inguinal 
glands. The ratio of spleen to body weight in this case was 
0.0084. On June 8, 1914, a mixture of spleen and liver tissue 
was inoculated subcutaneously into guinea pigs 6970 and 6971. 
These, at present, October 10, 1914, exhibit palpable tubercles 
in the inguinal region. 
SERIES C 
Two guinea pigs were inoculated with the spleen pulp of a 
third human case of leprosy on August 14, 1912; no acid-fast 
bacilli were found in a smear from the spleen. After over two 
years of observation, no signs of tuberculosis has appeared in 
either of these animals.
