Clear and cool. Wind north to north-west; rather strong.

  Spent the morning on the Coolidge Farm and
beyond starting at 8.30 and getting back at 1.30.
  As I left Mt. Auburn St[reet] and entered the lane past the
school house a Grass Finch and Bluebird were singing in
the field on the left and Grackles flying, with food for
their young, to the pitch pine woods behind John Coolidge's.
The old sand bank near the railroad has been dry out afresh
and the Bank Swallows have returned. I saw five there and
noticed some fresh holes.
  Entering the oak woods behind the Cemetery I found them
alive with birds. Orioles, Least Flycatchers, Yellow-throated and Red-
eyed Vireos, Wood Pewees & Redstarts were all numerous and in full
song. There were also two Black polls, one Parula, one Nashville Warbler,
and a Tanager, singing, and silent Cedar Birds in pairs. A very  
small Turdus bicknelli seemed to be inspired with uncontrollable  
curiosity regarding me for he approached within a few yards flitting
from oak to oak, once or twice singing sotto voce. I shot at but
missed him. I afterwards started an Swainson's Thrush from the 
ground and shot it but ruined the specimen. While watching
the Bicknell's Thrush I caught a glympse of a small bird darting
past and turned just in time to see a Sitta carolinensis alight at 
the entrance of what proved to be a nest - low down, in a natural
hole in an old apple tree at the north end of the large hollow.
The bird had its bill full of grubs and quickly entered the nest &
fed the young. Afterwards I saw both male & female come several times
with food.

In this apple orchard a House Wren, a Black poll Warbler, 
a Yellow- billed Cuckoo, and a Flicker, were singing. Least Flycatcher
abounded & I found one of their nests with the bird sitting.
English Sparrows were fairly numerous also, in this orchard.
