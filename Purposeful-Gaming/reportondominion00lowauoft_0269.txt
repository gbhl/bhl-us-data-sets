ESKIMOS 169 
The Eskimos have in addition to a number of legends con- 
cerning the creation of the animals many other folk-lore tales, 
all of a lewd character, and often Without point. 
The ideas concerning the future state of the soul are confused

calamity upon the band in this life, and punishes the individual 
in the next. When the taboos have been broken they can only 
be condoned by open confession, in the presence of an angekok, 
who, through his familiar spirit, reports the confession to 
Nuliayok, and the sin is forgiven. 
The following are a few of the many rules which must be 
observed: The most heinous crime is the concealment by a
