Anatomical Changes. Symptoms. 165 
The carcasses of animals dead from the disease are always 
greatly emaciated, and show manifestations of a general anemia 
and cachexia. 
Symptoms. The symptoms usually appear inside of 24 to 
48 hours after birth; exceptionally the disease may also occur 
somewhat later, and in rare cases the animals may be born 
affected with it. 
In some of the cases symptoms of a local affection of the 
umbilicus precede the general affection. The umbilicus swells, 
becomes sensitive and feels warmer than normal to the touch. 
The stump dries more slowly, while from the opening of the 
umbilical ring purulent or ichorous secretion may be pressed 
out. In the median line between the swollen umbilicus and the 
xyphoid cartilage, on the inner surface of the abdominal wall, 
a dense cord of the thickness of a finger may be felt. The 
affected animal moves but little, its gait is laborious and stiff, 
the desire for sucking is diminished, the body temperature is 
somewhat elevated. 
The symptoms of inflammation of the umbilicus may sub- 
side after a few days, especially when appropriately treated, 
and the patient may even completely recover. In the majority 
of cases, however, the local inflammatory processes increase 
in severity, and symptoms of a general septic infection develop 
sometimes rapidly, in other cases gradually. In rare cases the 
disease may develop without any preliminary inflammation 
of the umbilicus, with symptoms of a general infection. 
The general affection is indicated by symptoms of a general 
febrile condition. The animals lose their desire to suck, they 
will not look for the udder of their mother on their own accord, 
and if led to it they suck only a little or not at all. At the same 
time they are depressed and dull, and lie continually on the 
ground. When stood up on their feet they remain with droop- 
ing head in one place, or soon collapse. The body temperature 
is elevated and unevenly distributed over the body surface. 
The pulse and respiration are accelerated. This condition is 
soon followed by symptoms indicating a metastatic inflamma- 
tion in some of the internal organs. 
Inflammations of the joints make their appearance most 
frequently and earliest. One or more joints, preferably at the 
extremities (hock and knee joints), swell simultaneously, or one 
after the other, they become warm, painful, and tense, while 
the surrounding connective tissue is edematous. In some cases 
the swelling soon disappears; more frequently, however, a fluc- 
tuation may after a certain time be noticed in different parts 
of the swelling. This is followed by a breaking at one or more 
points, and from the resulting opening a tenacious purulent 
secretion is evacuated, first in great quantities, later more spar- 
ingly. By introducing a probe into the opening, a rough carti- 
laginous or bony surface may be felt at different places, while
