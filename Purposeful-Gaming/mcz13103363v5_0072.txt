Friday, May 14, 1869.
Clear and rather
warm. Ther. about
50[degrees] - 70[degrees] - 60[degrees].
Slept through the night
with my clothes on but
mother sat up. Father
this morning is very weak
& wanders in mind con-
tinually. Spent most
of the afternoon in the
room with him. He
began to take California
Hock today.
Late in P.M. father had
a very sick turn & I
had Katie harnessed
and went down into the
lower Port after the doctor.
He came up shortly after
accompanied by Dr. Allen
and examined father.
He says tonight will
be the crisis.
Staurday, May 15, 1869.

most of P. M. The horse
chestnuts are now
fully leaved out.
Slept part of last night
but did not take my
things off.
Ther. about 60[degrees] - 70[degrees] - 
60[degrees]. In A.M. had
the general harnessed

Spent most of the remaining
part of the day with him.
The doctor called three
times today and in the
evening said that he had 
passed the crisis but he
was still very feeble.
Mr. Russell came up
in the evening & passed
the night with us.
