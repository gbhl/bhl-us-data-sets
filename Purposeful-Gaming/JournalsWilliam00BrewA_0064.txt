Suwanee River, Florida.
creek, rather large structures of rather fine
twigs, rather neatly arranged. Two of my
birds were females which would have laid
in another week or so.
  I started five Wood Ducks in this creek
but they all flew in such a way that
I dared not shoot from my cranky
little canoe.
  This creek was narrow and winding with 
deep dark-colored water. Fish probably bass
were numerous jumping on all sides of
my canoe at times. On some of the large
floating logs rows of turtles lay sunning & I
saw one large alligator which rolled off the bank
with a great splash as I rounded a turn.
Prothonotary Warblers were exceedingly numerous
along the banks & I heard a few sing. Parulas
were everywhere in the tree tops. Saw one Flicker
the first for several days. Started two Barred Owls.
They are shy alert birds in the day time here.
Red-Shouldered Hawks screaming incessantly 
Cardinals & Carolina Wrens signing.
  Got in to our camp boat by noon &
worked on birds & letters all the afternoon.
A pair of Ospreys at their nest on the
opposite side of the river whistling & calling.
Have seen no Blue Jays for several days.
  Floated down stream about two miles and
tied to the east bank for the night. After
dark Dr Allen fired off a rocket when a panther(?)
yelled loudly in the bushes within twenty yards.
Out with Chapman in the evening taking a [pick?].
Saw nothing but some large bass swimming past.
