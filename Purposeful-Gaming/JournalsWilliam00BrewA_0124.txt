the floating vegetation with wings half-spread &[and] trailing. Of
course I knew what that meant and peeping into the grass
I saw the nest which contained 14 eggs, one on top of the
others. Later when I returned with a camera to photograph
this nest the eggs all lay in a single tier.
  There were a good many Red-wings in this swamp, a
few Swamp Sparrows, countless Rails of both species, and
one Marsh Wren besides the Gallinules. Of the latter I heard
at least three. They kept rather quiet while I was plashing 
about and crashing through the dry cat-tails.
  A Green Heron flew into &[and] from the Maph[?] Swamp where we
heard a Black-Poll and Water Thrush singing. Grackles
flying about continually. Swallows and a pair of Kingfishers.
In the afternoon a Sparrow Hawk who caused great excitement
among the Kid-wings.
  After lunch I crossed the railroad and made a long search
in the big meadow south of the Central. Heard Carolina Rails
and saw a pair of Va.[Virginia] Rails which evidently had young. Found
only one Rail's nest, apparently a Virginia's, in willows choked with
grass &[and] built up above the water. Heard a Gallinule when the "big
mystery" called last [?]. One Marsh Wren [?] in cat-tails.
  Recrossed the railroad and tried the bog between the brickyard
and the Fitchbury. A terrible morass, with treacherous, quaking
bottom &[and] reeking with filth from the slaughter house. Found a
Carolina Rail's nest with shells of eggs that had evidently been broken
when [?]. Coming out I startled a Va[Virginia] Rail from her nest
in a tussock on the very edge of the bog. One could reach 
it with slippered feet. Ten eggs. Took them but left the nest
as I wish to get the tussock with it, later.
  Denton left [?] him and went home. I joined
Jaxon and after [?] a Gallinule swim the ditch
once more we parted he going to [?] &[and] I to Porter's
by train.
