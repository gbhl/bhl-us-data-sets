past year. The oil and bone from these, together with the oil 
and pelts of 3,000 seals, and some bear, wolf, fox and walrus 
skins would realize a handsome profit, and lend encouragement 
to the continuation of the stations, which, for several years 
previous, had not cleared expenses. 
Mr. Noble informed us that white whales are abundant at 
the head of the gulf during the summer, where they frequent 
the flat, muddy mouth of a river. They are driven by whale- 
boats up the river, on the rising tide, and kept there until the 
tide falls, when they become stranded upon the mud flats and 
are easily killed. This fishery has only been prosecuted in a 
desultory manner, and would probably pay if handled with 
judgment 
Two rivers on the north side, and one at the head of the 
gulf, are famous for their large Arctic trout, or salmon, which 
abound in the mouths of these streams during August. There 
is no doubt that a profitable fishery could be prosecuted in all 
these streams, as well as in many others along the coast to the 
northward and southward of Cumberland gulf, but as yet no 
attempt has been made to fish them for export. 
The station at Kekerten consists of the usual half-dozen 
small buildings, all nicely painted, with the whaleboats ranged 
on skids, and barrels and tanks alongside clean and ready for 
use. 
The same evening a return was made to Blacklead, where, 
taking on board Captain Jackson, the new master of Cape 
haven station, and his boat's crew of natives, we left again, 
under a brilliant moon, for Cape Haven. The south shore of 
the gulf was closely followed, past innumerable bays and narrow 
channels formed by the islands and deeply indented shores of 
that side. 
Cyrus Field bay was reached late the next afternoon, with a 
strong northwesterly breeze. As the approach to Cape Haven is
