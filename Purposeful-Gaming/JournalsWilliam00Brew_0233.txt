1889
Feb. 15
Enterprise, Florida.
Clear and hot as July with a light S. wind all day.
  To Dago Prairie with C. starting at 8.00 a.m.
Saw nothing of interest on the drive out except
a flock of about seven Florida Grackles. Shot one
but it proved worhless having lost half the tail.
  Reaching the prairie began beating for Snipe
but found very few. I killed nearly all I
started - thirteen in number in thirteen shots. "Nelly"
found several of them & made some staunch
points. I made one double shot on Snipe & one
on Larks. Near the middle of the prairie, Nelly
flushed a King Rail from a bed of reeds. It
flew only a little distance but we could not
start it again. In the pines there was a
Hylotomus[?]. Meadow larks were singing all
over the prairie. Flushed one Henslow's Sparrow.
  Recrossing the railroad we next tried some
new ground for Snipe. "Nelly" found ten or
twelve of which I shot five. I missed six or
eight fairly good shots however. 
Cory killed ten Snipe in all. He shot badly at first but
killed all his last birds.
  In a wet meadow among short grass "Nelly" pointed
a second King Rail which C. shot. She also
flushed a Cistothorus stellaris.
  For some time we drove on before we sight five
White Egrets. At length they settled in a circular
meadow surrounded by moss-hung cypresses. As
we approached we discovered a large patch of snowy
white near them which C. at once pronounced to
be a flock of White Herons. The Herons gave the
