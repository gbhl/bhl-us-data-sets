1888
May 10
Cadillac, Michigan
Clear and warm. [?] 70 [degrees] at noon. High S. wind in P.M.
  Starting at 9.30 A.M. we drove to the lumber 
camp three miles E. of town and put up our horse.
The "boss" invited us to dinner which was served i one
of the buildings at 11 A.M. We sat down with about thirty
choppers mostly Swedes. The table was not nearly as good
as at a Maine camp but there was more variety - canned
things, pies, etc. The beans were wretched!
  After dinner we went in search of Pigeons. I soon lost
Dwight and kept on alone beating the woods carefully
for nearly two hours & refusing all shots at small birds
of which I saw and heard many, but finding no Pigeons
I finally began to shoot Warblers, [?] etc. Much of
the time I was in a woods composed almost wholly of 
Pinus resinosa, enormously tall, rather slender trees, the
ground beneath perfectly clear of underbrush & very level.
Pine Warblers and D. virens both abundant & in full song.
Saw two pairs of Juncos building & traced one to the nest
which was a hole in the level ground at least 12 in. below
the surface the entrance not over 2 in. in diameter. Brown
Creepers numerous and in full song. A Grouse drumming but
I could not find him. A Picoides arcticus chuck-ing. A
pair of Crossbills piping in the tops of the tall red pines.
A Chickadee's nest in a low beech stub the birds taking
away chips and dropping them a few yards off. Juncos
& Z. albricollis singing on every side. Sitta canadensis
whining, Blue Jays screaming everywhere, a Winter Wren singing.
  Crossed to the main road and walked along it west.
Heard a Grouse drum near the road and stalked him
carefully, the sound came from a spot where there were
several huge prostrate pine logs. I scanned them all
