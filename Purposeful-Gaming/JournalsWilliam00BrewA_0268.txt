Lake Umbagog, Maine
Oct. 11, 1890.
Cloudy with frequent heavy showers. Wind N.W., gusty & strong.
  Melvin went to Bottle Brook Pond for the day while I stayed
in camp skinning birds and writing. He killed one Black
Duck and his guide another. They saw a Duck in the
pond which they took to be a Mallard. Only a few
Black Ducks came in during the day.
  About camp I saw a White-bellied Nuthatch and 
two or three Hermit Thrushes. Three Canada Jays began
coming to the camp and made frequent visits during
the day, carrying off a quantity of bread. They have
been about ever since we came but have not made
us regular visits before to-day.

  Late in the afternoon I launched the gray Bernier canoe and 
had a short sail going nearly to Moose Point.
While off the mouth of the river on my return the drop
rudder gave out and I had some difficulty in
paddling ashore when Melvin & Sargent came
along and fixed the rudder for me. Saw several
flocks of Black Ducks and heard a Golden
Plover whistling.
