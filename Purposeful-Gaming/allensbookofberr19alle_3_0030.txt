Everbearing Varieties 
Everbearing strawberries can be grown Wherever other varieties are grown. Any 
good garden soil or any field that will produce good corn or other crops will grow strawber- 
ries successfully. Everbearing plants should be planted in early spring, hoed, cultivated 
and fertilized just as other varieties. For best results, the blossoms should be cut off 
until about the middle of July or first of August.
