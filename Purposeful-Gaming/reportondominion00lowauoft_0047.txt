VOYAGE TO THE BAY 13 
strong tides rush through the channels betWeen them, and al- 
though several of the channels are reported to be safe for large 
ships, they are only used by the natives as short cuts to 
Frobisher bay. 
Cape Haven was left late on the afternoon of the 8th, and 
Hall island, at the eastern extremity of the chain separating 
the bays, was passed in the early evening. The course was then 
laid across the mouth of Frobisher bay, to pass to the eastward 
of the great island of Resolution, lying on the north side of the 
entrance to Hudson strait. 
Monumental and Lady Franklin islands lie some twenty 
miles off the mouth of Cyrus Field bay, and are about ten miles 
apart. A continuous string of large icebergs stretched in a line 
between the islands, and continued for some miles beyond them, 
both north and south. They showed that the islands were but 
the exposed portions of a long dangerous bank, upon which the 
bergs had grounded. A similar line of bergs was observed 
about ten miles inside and parallel to the outer line. As this 
is the only knowledge possessed of these reefs, ships crossing 
them should use caution, although, in most places, sufficient 
water will probably be found. 
HUDSON strait. 
The bold, rocky shores of Resolution were passed during the 
night and early morning, and during the afternoon we steamed 
westward along the southern shores of Baffin island. 
The channel between Resolution and baffin islands is some 
miles wide, but is obstructed by a number of smaller islands. 
Very strong tides rush backwards and forwards through the 
channel, rendering dangerous an otherwise good passage. 
The southern shore of Baffin island is indented with many 
bays, and no doubt when this coast is surveyed excellent har- 
bours will be found along it. The land rises rapidly from the
