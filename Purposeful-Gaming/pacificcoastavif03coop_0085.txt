HYPOTHETICAL LIST. 
note:-this list consists of species which have been ascribed to California, 
but concerning which there is doubt either as to the evidence of their occurrence 
or as to their validity as species. Besides the thirty-three Species here enum- 
erated, some fifty others of still more doubtful standing have been credited to the 
State. But these were mostly recorded in the earlier writings, when "California" 
covered a much more extensive and indefinite area than now, and when matters 
of exact locality were not considered of so much importance. Many of these are 
west Mexican or even Central and South American species.
