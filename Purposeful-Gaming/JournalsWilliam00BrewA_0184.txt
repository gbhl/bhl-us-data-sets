in the grass watched those around me. After a little while 
six or seven of them began to hover over a little knoll 
covered with tall & very rank beach grass and finally all 
dropped nearly together or, rather, one after the other in quick 
succession, into the thickest part of the grass. I ran to the spot 
and found a veritable cluster of nests in shallow burrows under 
the grass, very differently placed from any of the Wilson's Terns nests I had 
seen. Most of these nests held only one egg but one had three 
eggs, one of which was on the point of hatching. I took this 
set of three but left the others for to-morrow.
  I now had to start for the house. On the way passed 
many nests of Wilson's Tern. Saw four or five Night Herons 
flying about over the bay alighting on the mud flats. 
Savanna Sparrows singing.
  Saw only one Laughing Gull at the N.E. end of the island 
but this one evidently had a nest there.
