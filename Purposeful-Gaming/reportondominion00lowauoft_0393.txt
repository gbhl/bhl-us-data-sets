WHALING 271 
within a few feet of the whale before it can be thrown with any 
certainty of success; otherwise the manner of capture is similar 
to that already described. 
Station whaling, which is very similar to that practised by 
the American ships, is carried on both in Baffin bay and Hud- 
son bay. The stations are either permanent establishments on 
land, or are small ships that remain constantly in the country, 
and serve only as a convenient dwelling for the small number of 
whites with each. 
At the present time land stations are operated at Kekerten 
and Blacklead, in Cumberland gulf and at Cape Haven, all on 
the east side of Davis strait. At the mouth of Ponds inlet in 
Baffin bay a small ketch is stationed; in Repulse bay a similar 
vessel is used as a whaling station. with the exception of Cape 
Haven these are owned in Scotland, the Cape Haven station 
belonging to a firm in Boston, u.s. 
Only one or two white men are employed at each, and the 
whaling is altogether in the hands of the natives. 
None of these stations are making great profits, and some of 
them are being maintained at a loss. They are of great assis- 
tance to the natives, and it is to be hoped that nothing will be 
done to discourage the owners, who according to present returns 
should be helped rather than hindered in their work. 
The natives have for years looked for assistance to the 
Whalers both on Baffin island and Hudson bay. They have quite 
given up the use of their primitive weapons, and there is no 
doubt that a withdrawal of the Whalers would lead to great 
hardship and many deaths among these people if the Govern- 
ment did not in some manner take their place and supply the 
Eskimos with the necessary guns and ammunition. 
The influence of the Whalers upon the natives does not appear 
to have been as bad as in the western part of the Arctics. The 
excessive use of alcohol has never been practised, and has now
