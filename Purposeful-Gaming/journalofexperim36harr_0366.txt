EXPLANATION OF FIGURES 
1 A normal frontonia approaching the end of an oscillatoria fiber prior to 
ingestion. 
2 Oscillatoria fiber entering the body of the frontonia. Characteristic shape 
of the organism during the early stage of ingestion of linear objects. 
3 and 4 Turning of the body of the frontonia in order to relieve the stimula- 
tion at the first tension point (fig. 3, a). 
4 to 6 The body cilia is pushing the frontonia in the direction of the food and 
thus forcing the end of the object posteriorly along the aboral wall. 
7 and 8 The fiber reaches the posterior end of the organism and causes an 
elongation of the body of the frontonia. 
9 The fiber breaks and ingestion continues by the oral cilia pulling the mouth 
along the object.
