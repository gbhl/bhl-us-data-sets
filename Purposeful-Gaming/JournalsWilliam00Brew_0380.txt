1889
Sept. 23
Clear and cold with high N.W. wind which died away at sunset.
  H. W. Henshaw arrived on the steamer this morning and
spent the day in camp. Late in the afternoon he took the
steamer back to Lakeside and I accompanied him. Alva
Coolidge on the boat. He tells me he saw a flock of eighteen 
Blue-wing Teal in Metallak Pond on the 18th. None have been
reported at Umbagog this year. He also tells me that he has
seen Woodcock on the Cupsuptic carry and at L. Parmachuner.

  Just below Great Island we sighted a flock of seven
American Scoters. Alva offered me a little cedar cause he had
with him and in it Jim and I at once started
after the birds which proved very wild. By chasing them
about for an hour or more and firing ten or a dozen
long shots at them however I managed to get two. Used
the little 20 gauge.

Sept. 24
Clear, still and warm. A superb day. The foliage turning fast.
  C.F.B and E.K.S. came up on the steamer with me this
morning and spent the day at camp. No shooting of
course. The usual small birds about the camp.
After the steamer had departed for Lakeside with the ladies
in the afternoon I started for Moose Point with Spelman. 
On the flooded meadows near the Outlet I found a Red 
Phalarope floating dead. Saw it nearly a half a mile off
but did not feel sure it was a bird until I was within
a few yards. It had been shot in the side and was only
a few hours dead.

  A few Ducks came into the marsh this evening 
but we got no shots. Two Wood Ducks passed near 
Spelman but he did not see them until too late to
shoot. Although the water was two to three feet deep all over 
the marsh we heard many Carolina Rails calling kep, kr-ep
at sunset.
