Golden Winged Warbler on the singing notes
of a Field Sparrow. A Grouse was drumming
regularly in some Oak Woods across the turn-
pike and a pair of Downy Woodpeckers sounding 
their call taps in the tops of some tall Chestnuts.
Then there were Fowlers, Song Sparrows, Robins
and Flickers joining their voices to the chorus
at more or less frequent intervals. Truly the
Old orchard with its' glory of blossoms, Emerald
turf and sylvian surroundings was a scene
fit for the Gods, this gray, misty May morning.
