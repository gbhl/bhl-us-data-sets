Sunday, July 25, 1869.
  Clear and very warm.
Ther. about 72[degrees] - 
80[degrees] - 80[degrees].
Rose late & had
breakfast at 8.30
A.M. Spent the
forenoon reading
and the P.M.
in writing letters
and in writing
up my diary.
We cannot really
have been said to
have had a single
pleasant day so
far for clouds are
continually drifting
through the valley
& we have slight
showers quite fre-
quently.
Monday, July 26, 1869.
  Alternately cloudy 
& clear. Ther. about
70[degrees] - 85[degrees] - 70[degrees].
Had several heavy
showers.
Rose as usual. At about
11 A.M. took my fishing
pole & struck up through
the woods to Nineteen
Mile Brook which
I fished down to the
road, although I took
no dinner with me.
Had good sport taking
one hundred & fifteen
trout, some of them good
fish.
Got back to the
house at about 6 P.M.
rather wet & very hungry.
Spent the evening
about the hotel
as usual.
