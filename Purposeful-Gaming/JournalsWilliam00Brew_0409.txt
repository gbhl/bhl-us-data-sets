1889
Oct. 25
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Clear with light S.E. wind. Hard frost last night.
  Just after breakfast heard Pine Grosbeaks whistling behind 
the camp. Went in search of them & came upon four, all adult 
males. Shot one. Heard a flock of Pine Linnets & a Goldfinch also.

  Off at 10 a.m. Went first to Leonard's Pond. A Sheldrake & 
a brown Hooded Merganser there. Fired a long flying shot at 
the latter but missed. Passing out by Moose Point saw a
superb Shrike. As he flew up from the grass & alighted on a 
root he looked so white that I took him at first for
a Snow Bunting.

  Rowed from Moose Point to Rapid River. On the way started 
a flock of nine Scaup Ducks (F. marila, I think). They rose very
wild and we did not try to get a shot at them after
they alighted.

  Reaching the mouth of the river I took a station on its 
west bank & sent Jim up with the boat to drive the birds
down. First came a flock of six Hooded Mergansers, doubtless 
the same seen yesterday. They passed over me too high for a
shot. After them came some Golden-eyes also too high. 
Finally a high Sheldrake came down before the wind 
flying very fast & passing within 15 yds. of me. I shot
both barrels and made a clean miss with each.

  While Jim was tramping through the woods after Grouse
(of which he shot two) I spent the afternoon lying in wait
for Ducks, part of the time at the old piers. Nothing
passed except two Whistlers, very high.
  Started back to camp at dusk. Just as we were leaving
the landing a Grouse came skimming across the river 
& plumped down into a cluster of yew. As I approached
I could hear her rustling among the leaves. I went in
but failed to find her. Probably she had settled there for the night.
I used the little canoe to-day, Jim going in his own boat.
