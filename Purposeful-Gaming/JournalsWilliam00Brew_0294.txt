1889
(May 14)
the dense pitch pines on the hill north of the runs. It flew
only a few rods but he could not mark it and we
searched for it in vain. He also flushed a Grouse.
I killed a Dend. caerulescens that was singing in a birch
swamp.
  Nashville Warblers were fairly numerous, Chestnut-sided not
up to their usual numbers, Minotilla rather scarce. We heard
only one Grosbeak. Several Red eyed Vireos singing. No
Tanagers, a Prairie Warbler in a new locality which I shot
and another in the old ground near the entrance to the
lane.
  At 2 P. M. fog settled in from seaward and it began to
rain. We started home by a roundabout way via the
Willows. A few Swallows flying over the fields. A [male]
Marsh Hawk at the W. end of the Willows scaling over the
road. I must look for his nest later in the old spot.
Very few small birds along the causeway except Yellow
Warblers and one fine [male] D. maculata which I killed.
Nothing unusual seen on the drive home except a
Meadow Lark whistling near the corner of School St.
  At 4 P. M. I started another drive with C.
going around Fresh Pond, thence to and through
Payson Park where we heard a Meadow Lark whistling.
Warbling Vireos, Orioles and Least Flycatchers in
abundance everywhere along the road. A Cat Bird
singing in lilacs.
  Apple trees still in bloom but the blossoms faded
to pure white & petals falling. Columbines at their
best this morning some of the beds superb. Saw a
pair of Yellow-billed Cuckoos in a tree over the
road near Bird's Pond.
