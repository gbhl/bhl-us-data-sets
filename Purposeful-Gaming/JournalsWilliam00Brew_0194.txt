1888
(Nov. 17)
my shot.
  I did not miss a really fair shot all day but
fired a number of ineffectual ones at long range
or through dense brush. In one place "Don" came
to a point among barberry bushes on the edge
of a meadow and three Grouse went out in
different directions but all in such a way that
they were covered by the bushes until nearly out
of range despite the fact that the place was
very open with nothing much higher than one's
head.
  "Don" found the Quail in a weed field. I
shot one as they rose (firing only one barrel) and
the other among thick scrub on the hillside
to which they retreated.
  In all "Don" made probably a dozen staunch
points on Grouse. The scent was evidently very
strong all day owing, probably, to the fact that
the leaves were soaked by yesterday's rain.
  We saw almost no small birds. A few
Blue Jays and Chickadees, a flock of about 20
Chrysometris tristis, a Zonotrichia albicollis, and
a Woodpecker not identified but probably a P. villosus.
