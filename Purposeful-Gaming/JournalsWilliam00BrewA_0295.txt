Errol Hill Pond.
swimming past my [?]. Jim failed
to slam the Buffle heads much so I went
around the pond and tried to stalk
them. Got within [?] [?] as they were
diving under a Steep hillside and whom
all them were under water made a run
for the Home.. He came to the [?]face
before I stopped, saw me and flew when I
Knocked it down with a broken wing.
Another then came up and I killed it.
The wind went off instead[?] at. The wounded
one swam across the pond but would not
go ashore. So I decided it useless to follow it.
  While Sitting quietly among the aldus I
heard another Shrew [?] sing a number
of times(On Oct[ober] 15). It came past me within
ten feet jumping from one [?] of grass to the
next occasionally swimming a small pool, singing
continuously the while. Its song was any like
a bird's, perhaps a young Song Sparrow's, but further
I should call it a warbling whistler for it
was very Slight indeed but nevertheless liquid
and musical throughout a succession of many
notes rising and falling the whole Casting at
least half a minute. The creature was very
small and dark brown in color. It was
positively a shrew and not a mouse.
About sunset heard a Brown [?] sing
four or five times mainly as loudly and
well as in Spring. Back to camp by 5 P.M.
Will Sargent Started a pair of [?] in the
woods near camp &[and] tried from [?] at [?]
on the [?] but missed [?] [?] him.
