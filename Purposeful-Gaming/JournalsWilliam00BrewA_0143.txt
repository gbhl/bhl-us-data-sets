1890
June 1  
Maryland to Concord, Massachusetts
Cloudless with strong N.W.[north west] wind yet warm - perhaps the warmest day
thus far.
  We started down river at 8.30. No Bitterns ?pumping and only
one Carolina Rail which whineyed in the marsh below the
railroad  bridge.  Photographed a King Bird's nest with 4 eggs in 
button rushes over water. Found a snapping twitter of the largest
kind but very young and not larger than a small saucer floating
on the surface in the middle of the river. He made no attempt
to elude my hand and I took him into the boat.
  Landed just above the ??? bridge and spent about two
hours watching the  ?? swallow colony and taking notes on
their interesting social economy. The Orchard Oriole singing
at frequent intervals in an orchard some distance from but
within hearing of the elm when we left him May 30th,
Least Flycatchers and Warbling Vireos singing. Our Barn Swallow
among the Eaves.
  Crossed the big meadow again under sail. Found a Red-wings
nest with one egg which the water just reached on the under side
the bottom of the nest being very wet.
  Lunched under a meadow oak a little above Pantry Brook.
Chestnut-sided Warblers singing all along the wood edges. Two
Yellow-billed Cuckoos calling.
  Resumed our way at 2 P.M. Wind very strong giving us
some hard work but we had the current with us and 
occasionally used the sail for a short stretch. Our Red-wing
with the bell-note in the same place when we saw him
on the 30th.
  A Red-tailed Hawk again soaring over Fairhaven. The only
Indigo Bird noted during the entire trip singing in maple
woods just below ?Nirn ?Arm Bridge. On the sloping gravelly
bank opposite the French's farm a dozen Sand Martins
