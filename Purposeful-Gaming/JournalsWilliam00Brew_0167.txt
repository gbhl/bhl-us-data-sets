1888
Oct. 10.
Lake Umbagog, Maine
Cloudy with high N. W. wind and frequent
snow squalls nearly a duplicate of yester-
day but colder and less snow falling. Mead-
ows frozen in places among the grass. Ground
in woods covered with about 1 inch of snow
Off at 8. A. M. going first to Outlet. Meadows
entirely under water and no birds. Thence
to Moose Point. Started about 20 Black Ducks
out of range. Saw three Marsh Hawks (two
adult [males]) and a Pigeon Hawk all beating
about over an acre or so at once. Next saw
two Black Ducks feeding. They discovered us
and flew but one alighted again in a pool
among the tall grass. One of the Marsh
Hawks dashed down at her at least a dozen
times. We could not see the Duck but at each
swoop of the Hawk she quacked loudly.
On reaching the pool we found the Duck
gone. I put "Don" into the grass and he
soon started her and I shot her as she
rose. Next to Leonards Pond. Two Scaups
started and went out then a Black Duck.
We then discovered four Wood Ducks and a
Green winged Teal. I landed and stalked
them but could only find the Teal which
swam repeatedly past me within a few
yards quacking incessantly in a nasal
cracked tone almost like the scaipe of a
Snipe. At length he put his head under
his wing and went to sleep. Failing to
get a sight at the Wood Ducks I finally
shot the Teal and quickly replaced the
