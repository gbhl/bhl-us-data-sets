1889
(June 1)
four o'clock. During this time I searched closely for
Bobolink's nests and watched the females but without
success. I also waded out to the middle of the meadow
when I examined two islands covered with taller ferns &
a few thickets of alders. Two pairs of Bobolinks here. Two
Carolina & one Virginia Rail in the intermediate meadow
where the water was fully a foot deep. Searched for their
nests but found only three Red-wings', two with 4 eggs each,
one with three young. A Bittern pumping. Flush a Carolina
& a Virginia Rail here. No Savanna Sparrows on the meadow
this year.
  Just as Denton was landing I saw a Bobolink alight and
running to the spot flushed her from the nest which held
five eggs. Returning to the upper ground we beat it again
and I found a third nest, also with five eggs, near "the
tent"
  Denton had found two King-birds' nests one with 4 eggs
which he took. We reached the Manse at 6.15 P. M.
  Heard one Oriole and a single Grosbeak on the river
banks. No warbling Vireos below Flint's Bridge this year.
Bobolinks in about the usual numbers. Not nearly as
many Swallows as there should have been, considering the
day, and only two Martins. A good many Chimney Swifts.
Only a very few Yellow Warblers. Perhaps they were not singing!
Saw no less than six Red-wings' nests in the button bushes
but only examined three, two with 4, one with 2 eggs.
Saw one Kingfisher and two Tringoides. A Quail whistling
at intervals in a thicket of willows on the Great Meadow
side of the river. A Short-billed Marsh Wren singing
near the Oak Island.
