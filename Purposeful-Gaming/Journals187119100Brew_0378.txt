Clear and warm; wind S. W.
  Spent the morning packing and at 2.30 P.M.
started for Bethel in one of Lovejoy's teams, a light
wagon that had brought two sportsmen up yesterday.

  The drive, despite the high wind, was very pleasant for 
the air was warm and the road in remarkably good 
condition. The autumn coloring was still brilliant in 
spots although long past its prime for we have had several
sharp frosts of late that have [?] the leaves in all
save the most sheltered places. In fact many of the trees
were bare and the ground beneath them strewn with
the leaves among which squirrels and several birds [?]
as we passed.

  About midway to the long hill to Upton I saw a 
Lincoln's Finch. It dodged into a tough of raspberry bushes
as we approached then boldly mounted to the rail of the 
fence behind and crouched then facing us showing its
buffy breast so plainly that I made sure of its identity.

  In Grafton below the notch we passed a fine adult
White-crowned Sparrow in nearly the same way. It was,
however, alone - in bushes near a house - whereas the 
Lincoln's Finch was in company with other Sparrows.

the Lake, became numerous along the [?].
