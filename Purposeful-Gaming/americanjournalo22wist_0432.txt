langes, and a lumbrical muscle is also found attached to it. The 
median nerve normally supplies the lumbrical muscle to the 
second and third digits, the ulnar those to the fourth and fifth. 
The single lumbrical here present is supplied by the median, a 
further proof that the digit is the second or third. 
The digit is thus either the index or middle finger, but to 
decide upon which of these two it is, is much more difficult as 
there is nothing in the disposition of the muscles to help solve 
the problem. The distribution of the cutaneous branches of 
the median nerve seem to offer the only key to the solution. In 
text figures C and D is given side by side the cutaneous distri- 
bution of the median nerve in this foetus and in the normal 
hand. As the cutaneous distribution of the median is wholly 
digital it is assumed that branches found from the trunk of the 
median running into the hand were intended for those digits 
which did not appear. By checking these off against the 
branches in the normal hand it is found that the digit here pres- 
ent ought to be the index finger. 
There is a palmar cutaneous branch from the median arising 
in the lower half of the forearm and ending in the palm. It is 
not to be mistaken here for one of the digital nerves, these latter 
arising in the palm. There are three such nerves, only the 
middle one passing out on the digit, where it forks to supply 
each border, while the flexor profundus tendon passes on under 
it. The other two nerves end at the base of the digit on its 
medial and lateral borders. To save a long description the 
reader is referred to the figure explaining the distribution of 
these nerves. Here at a glance it can be seen that the part of 
the nerve found on the digit in this foetus, is the portion to the 
index finger from the first and second common volar digital 
branches. From this distribution it seems fairly definite that 
the sole remaining digit on this hand is the index finger. 
On the arm which was not dissected it will be remembered 
that in addition to the single finger carried at the end of the 
limb there was a well developed digit found on the medial side 
of the elbow. Radiographs showed this to contain a metacarpal 
and three phalanges. Of course, this digit can be logically as-
