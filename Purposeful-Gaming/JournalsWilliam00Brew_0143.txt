1888
Sept. 29.
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Fair with intervals of sunshine and
every now and then a snow squall.
Once it snowed hard for 15 minutes
whitening ground and trees. Wind N. W.
and very strong and cold all day.
Off at 7. A. M going first to Moose Point.
Meadows at Outlet a foot under water
Three Hooded Mergansers diving among
the grass. very shy. One Black Duck
at Moose Point also ad. Marsh Hawk.
Thence to Sweat Meadow. Found fully 
50 Black Ducks scattered about among
the grass. While trying to paddle
within shot we heard two guns
above us and all the Ducks flew.
Three gunners had entered the pond
after us and spoiled our chance. We
prepared to stay all day and our
rivals soon left. We lunched back in
the woods. Lumen started a Grouse.
Two Canada Jays came about attrac-
ted by our fire. After lunch saw
three Black Ducks alight in the grass
Lumen paddled me to them and
I had a fine chance for a double
shot as they rose but missed with
my first barrel. Later several bunches
of Ducks came in but none alighted
till nearly dark when four Black
Ducks accompanied by a Green-winged
Teal pitched down behind some
bushes. We paddled to the bushes and
