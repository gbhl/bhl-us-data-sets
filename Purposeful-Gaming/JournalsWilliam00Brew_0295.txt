1889
May 16
Cambridge, Mass.
Clear and warm tempered by light E. wind.
  To the Maple Swamp at 9 A. M. for the forenoon.
Entered by the Alewife Brook path as usual. A Least
Flycatcher singing in the willows on the causeway, a
Cat-bird in the thickets behind these willows, and Yellow
Warblers on all sides.
  In the tall maples by the brook found several migrants
a Turdus swainsoni (calling peenk) a Dendroica caerulescens
and a D. striata singing, and several Ixoreus naevius
chirping and singing. A vireo olivaceus was also a new
comer to these woods since my last visit. Besides these
there were numerous yellow Warblers, several Redstarts, a
few silent Veery Thrushes, two dull colored Z. albricollis
and a pair of Flickers. Outside the maples in some
low willows a Sylvania pusilla was dancing about
in the usual erratic manner, jerking his tail and
making occasional upward leaps after flying insects.
  Crossing the meadow I passed through the middle
island and entered the eastern maples. Here were
two Least Flycatchers, three Grosbeaks (two [male] one [female]) and
a Robin or two besides another Red-eye and many
Yellow Warblers. Females of the latter were collecting
material for their nests everywhere to-day. I shot
several of them as well as one Water Thrush.
  In the thickets north of this swamp I also shot
a [female] Robin much to my regret for it happened quite
by accident I mistaking the bird for a Grey cheeked
Thrush.
  Crossing the railroad I tramped over much of the
open meadow to the north finding a Red-wing's nest
(in a Willow) with one egg but shooting nothing except
