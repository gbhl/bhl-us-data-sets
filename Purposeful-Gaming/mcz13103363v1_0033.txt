Its flight was rather
slow and as it flew its
head was protruded
forward.

Humming bird
[margin]July 15, 1865[/margin]
  Saw one, it was lighting
on a dead locust tree
and after flying about
some bushes it disappeared
in an elm tree. I suppose 
it was a Ruby throated
but was not near enough
to tell.

  Saw one while riding in
Newton its flight was very
swift and it flew towards
the North west. I do not know
what kind it was. R. Deane

resembled that of the Blue bird.
