and flushed two Grouse getting a fair shot at one but
missing it. Shortly afterwards the pointer found one of
these birds a second time and stood it staunchly among
scrub oaks on a hillside. I flushed and shot it
We could find nothing more so returned to the barn,
harnessed the horse, & started homeward.

  Reaching Prospect St. & finding that there was still
a brief time of daylight we tied the horse & beat the
birch runs. Found no game but saw some "dustings"
of Quail among oak scrub. There was an immense
flock of Robins here, in birches, fully one hundred birds.
They passed over us on their way to a roost on Rock Meadow.
I shot one as it went over me. We saw many going
in the same direction from other quarters. Saw, also, five
Field Sparrows among some bushes.

  The day's adventures closed here our ride home being
in the twilight.
