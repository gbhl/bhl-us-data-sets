1890
May 15
Concord, Mass.
Cloudy with almost no wind. Began raining at 10.A.M.
and continued with occasional short intermissions
during the entire day.
  To Concord by 9 A.M. train with Faxon. Got
my boat at the Manse and at once started
down river. Fewer birds than usual in the Manse
orchard - a pair of White bellied Swallows, a Least
Flycatcher, several Robins and an Oriole or two.
No Bluebirds & no Nuthatch. Bobolinks & Meadow Larks
singing in the meadow across the river and
Redwings along the banks. A [Phoebe?] at the bridge. 
  On our way down to the meadows started
three Solitary Sandpipers and as many Spotted.
King-birds in pairs flitting about the button
bushes and willows. Bobolinks on every side & a
few Swallows. An Osprey high in air flying down
river. At the wooded reach above Hunt's Pond a
Night Heron and a Wilson's Black-cap the 
latter singing in the top of a tall maple. 
It began to rain just as we reached Hunt's Pond
and in a few minutes it became a positive
pour. Evidently we were in for a wet day but
we kept on to Ball's Hill. Just below Dallin's Hill
heard an Oriole who inhabited the same belt of
river maples in 1886 and 1887. I recognised him
at once by the high pitch of some of his notes.
  At Ball's Hill landed and walked about for 
an hour or more in the dripping woods. Once,
when the rain held up for a bit, the birds
began to sing and we heard Red-eyes, a 
Tanager, a Grosbeak and numerous Cat-birds
