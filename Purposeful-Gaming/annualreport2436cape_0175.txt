in as ingle year is only about $3500. As already pointed out our 
expenditure was over $5000, so that the Station is putting- into the 
work out of general funds a sum considerably in excess of the $1250 
which I have tried to show you would be an equitable share in the 
total. I trust, therefore, that you will agree with me that we are 
putting into the work as much as under present conditions can be 
expected, but I wish to assure you that I am disposed to do as much 
in the interests of cranberry growing as the conditions under which 
we work will justify. 
I believe that on consideration of the facts stated you will 
agree with me in my conclusion. What then can be done to render 
it unnecessary that Dr. Franklin shall use a part of his valuable 
time for work not absolutely requiring a man' of his ability ? Per- 
haps you will think that we should go to the Legislature for an in- 
crease in appropriations. That during the next four years at least 
would be highly unwise for there was a tacit understanding at the 
time when the annual increase to which I have referred was voted 
that no more should be asked during the period covered by the act. 
You will see, therefore, that our hands are practically tied, and if 
you believe that an assistant should be employed, either you your- 
selves must provide the funds, or, if you think best, you as cran- 
berry growers may appeal to the Legislature for a special appro- 
priation for cranberry work. 
You may be interested in the artificial cranberry bogs which 
have been referred to in earlier years, which have been devised and 
put in in the hope of throwing light upon the specific effects of 
different plant food elements and combinations upon the cranberry. 
The illustrations in the pamphlets which have been distributed will 
make the construction and general equipment of these bogs clear. 
The cylinders which are two feet in diameter and four feet 
deep were filled nearly to the top with thoroughly mixed cedar 
swamp peat, collected and forwarded to Amherst through the 
courtesy of your president. Care was taken to put precisely the 
same weight in each. Equal care was taken to cover the peat after 
it had been settled with precisely equal weights of sand to the depth 
of about four inches. The vines were set in the usual way. You 
will notice that the arrangement makes it possible to hold water 
in these bogs at any desired level and by the addition in winter of 
galvanized iron rings the bogs are flooded as in commercial cran- 
berry growing. 
The questions will arise in the minds of some I presume: Why 
so much trouble and expense? Why not determine the specific 
effects of plant food elements and combinations in the open bog? 
Would it not be better to try experiments of that kind on a larger
