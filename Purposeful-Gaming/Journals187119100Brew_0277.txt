(May 10)
Yellow-winged Sparrows were singing. I think
I have never seen them as early before.
  Shad bush in full bloom to-day.
  In the evening there was a deafening
chorus of toads and hylas in the flooded
meadows behind the Manse; also the occasional
troup of a bull frog.
  The river is falling past and the grass
springing up above the water on the flooded
meadows.
  I heard Thrashers calling in the 
air at 10 P.M..
