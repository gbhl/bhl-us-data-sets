vicinity.
  Just as we reached the boat and were preparing
to embark it began to rain and the wind rapidly
increased to almost a gale. At the same moment
Ducks began to appear in some numbers, evidently
driven to the shelter of the timber by the storm.
First came the Wood Ducks, next a flock
of six Sheldrake, then a pair of Black Ducks
and finally a flock of a dozen or more Black
Duck. None came within shot although several
came very near it.

  Pushing off we started up river in the teeth of
a furious gale of wind and driving rain, hugging
the east shore. In the midst of this shower I
heard a Song Sparrow & several Red-wings singing.
As we were passing a stubble field a small
flock of Redpolls pitched down into it. I landed
and shot two at one discharge.

  A little above Ball's Hill three Wood Ducks passed
nearly within range. In the bush we found
a black bass that would have weighed at least
three pounds. It was floating belly up, dead.
  Setting sail we crossed the Great Meadow easily
and swiftly and landed at the east side of
Ripley's Hill. There was a large flock of Rusty
Grackles in the maple swamp. Among the pines
we saw a Grouse which flew out of a tree &
skimmed off down hill into the swamp.
  Reached the Manse at 5 P. M, pretty thoroughly wet
and chilled.
  Saw a single Osprey during the day but
no other hawk except the Red-tails. Where was Circus?
