summer CRUISE 53 
wooden cenotaph surmounted by a round ball and set in a small 
platform of cemented limestone was erected to the memory of 
Franklin and his heroic associates by one of the subsequent 
expeditions, and to-day stands in a fair state of repair. resting 
face-downward on the platform, alongside of the cenotaph, was 
a large marble slab, inscribed, as a tribute to the memory of 
Franklin and the crews of the Erebus and Terror, by citizens 
of the United States. A brass plate, affixed to the lower part of 
the slab, records that it had been brought from Disko to its 
present resting place by McClintock in the Fox, when he 
obtained final proof of the total destruction of Franklin's ill- 
fated party. The slab was raised and photographed, and then 
replaced on the ground to avoid the danger of its being broken 
by the winds. If another expedition visits this place the 
material for a suitable foundation for the slab should be taken, 
so that it may be erected as originally intended. 
On the barren plain, a few hundred yards from the house, are 
four graves marked by small wooden crosses, the last resting 
place of two of Franklin's crews and two belonging to the search 
parties. 
A sealed tin case was found attached to the cenotaph, and on 
opening it a record of the Norwegian Magnetic Pole Expedi- 
tion was found. The record stated that the Gjoa, with the 
expedition on board, had arrived here in the latter part of 
August, 1903, after having picked up the provisions left for 
them at Dalrymple island by one of the Scotch Whalers, and 
were proceeding immediately down Peel sound in order to get 
their ship as near as possible to the magnetic pole before the 
sound became frozen over. As this was the last tidings from 
this expedition the record was taken away, and since our return 
has been forwarded to the Norwegian government. The Gjoa 
in which the expedition sailed is a small but stout sloop, with 
auxiliary power supplied by a gasolene engine. The only
