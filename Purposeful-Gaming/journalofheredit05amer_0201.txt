THE QUEENSLAND NUT. 
A delicious nut of Australian origin, which is creating much interest in California. It is resistant 
to drouth and fairly resistant to frost, and promises to be of much value commercially in 
the warmer parts of the United States. Extensive plantings are being made, but mostly 
in an experimental way, or for ornamental purposes. Thickness of shell is the only defect 
of the nut, and this is one that is easily amenable to improvement by selection. In texture 
and flavor, the kernel resembles that of a Brazil nut, and is universally liked; small ship- 
ments from Queensland to London are said to have been sold at $2.50 a pound. Photo-
