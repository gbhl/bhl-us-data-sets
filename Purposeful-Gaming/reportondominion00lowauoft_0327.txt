GEOLOGY 217 
' There are at havnefjord, in Jones sound, above some layers 
of quartz-sandstone, which entirely cover the gneiss-granite 
there, a series of limestone conglomerates with marly schists 
and pure limestones of a thickness of 1,200 to 1,500 feet. These 
are again overlain by a series of beds at least 2,000 feet thick, 
of hard, impure limestones, brown or yellowish-gray in colour, 
and often remarkably heavy.' 
' At South cape, which is entirely composed of this brown 
limestone, are found in the lower parts Maclurea sp., and 
halysites Sp., referable to the Middle Silurian, while west of it, 
at Bjorneborg, the upper parts of the series contain badly pre- 
served remains of Orthocerata, Corals, and Pentamerus cfr. 
tenuistriatus. Hereafter the upper part of the limestone seems 
to be equivalent to the older Upper Silurian (Landovery). This 
brown limestone occurs from South cape westward to Kobbe- 
bugten in Hell Gate, and is broken at Lille Sandor, tectonic 
disturbance bringing up the underlying conglomerate series, 
and even the Archaean.' 
* On the south side of rendalen appears the brown limestone 
of the capes, Series A, with a flat dip to the north-northwest; 
but on the north side of the valley is a division of dark schist, 
Series B, lying conformably above the beds of brown limestone. 
Associated with these schists, particularly in their lower and 
upper parts, are numerous layers of pure dark limestone, fre- 
quently fossiliferous. In rendalen and in Kobbebugten, where 
this same division also appears, a quantity of material was 
collected, of which fifteen species are provisionally determined, 
among them being Favosites sp., strophomena cfr. euglypha, 
meristella in numbers, rhynchonella cfr. borealis, Pentamerus 
cfr. galeatus, Spirifer cfr. elevatus. The period of this divi- 
sion in Series B is Wenlock.' 
' The upper part of Series B appears, among other places, at 
the headland north of Tunneldalen, in hvalrosfjord. Above a
