shot two. We started the Quail as we were driving
through the pine woods and shot down six
but having no dog lost two. I lost only one Snipe
all day.
  On the drive out I made a very long shot
(fully sixty yards) at an Ardea egretta which
was standing in a pond among rushes near
the roadside. I also shot two Cot. henslowi
on Dago and saw another there. The most
interesting birds seen were five Sandhill Cranes
two in one bunch, three in another, which
we started while driving across Dago. They rose
at fully 500 yds. and flew out of sight,
carrying their necks stretched out to the
full length.
  The morning was very beautiful, the sky
cloudless, the evergreen foliage of the oaks, myrtles
etc. glistening, as if wet, in the sunlight.
It was so warm and summer like that it seemed
strange not to hear birds singing but the
woods were silent everywhere.
  On the drive home just at dusk a Whippoorwill
flew out of some scrub and alighted in
the middle of the road just in front of
the horses. I saw the white on the tail
distinctly and then made sure that it
was a male.
  Mr. Correns shooting wholly on Dago bagged
47 Snipe to-day. H[?] our three guns
bagged in all 91 besides the Quail of which
Mr. Correns killed twelve making over a
hundred birds in all.
