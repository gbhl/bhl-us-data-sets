Oct.15
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
  Alternately cloudy and clear with violent squalls of wind
accompanied by brief showers of hail or rain. Beautiful cloud
effects at times. Air chilly but temperature not really low.
  Just after breakfast we saw a large flock of Scoters
flying past B. Brook Cove but before we could get ready
to pursue them the wind rose to such a degree that we
dared not venture out on the broad part of the Lake.
We accordingly decided to take a two days trip up
the Megalloway and started at about 10 a.m.

On the way up to Bottle Brook we saw a number 
of Sheldrake and M. had a good shot at one flock
but failed to kill any of them. He went up Bear Brook
and started a Black Duck there but did not get a 
shot at it.

  In Bottle Brook Pond we found a flock of 17
Black Ducks. They were feeding in the middle arm
and M. crept out on the left hand point while I
took the right hand. The flock came over to my
side and I started them by creeping out along
a long, shallow ditch which extends nearly to the
water's edge through the marsh. I got within about
40 yds. when they began to swim out into the pond.

  I shot one barrel at four or five that were somewhere
near together killing one and wounding another while
with my second barrel I dropped a single bird.
The wounded Duck flew down the arm to the 
river bank then turned to the right into the
woods where Don found it in a hole under the
roots of an upturned tree. It proved to be a 
partial albino, a beautiful bird mottled on
the back & wings with pure white.
