woman of a miscarriage, and is the source of the greatest 
calamities. A woman so unfortunate must confess immediately 
to the angekok, but as the confession practically ostracizes her 
for several months, the temptation to conceal her mishap is 
great. A pregnant woman is debarred from eating several kinds 
of meat. After childbirth she is unclean for two or three 
months, and for the first month cannot visit any house in the 
community. a similar rule applies to women during their 
menses. A woman who has recently lost a relative must not 
work on deerskins, pluck ducks, take the hair off sealskins nor 
mention the names of the animals. When the men are away

eyes punctured, so that its spirit may not see that it is being 
taken to the snow-house. When the carcass is brought into the 
house fresh snow is dipped into the kettle and the water from 
it is dripped over the seal's mouth. Before going sealing, for the 
first time on the ice, a fire of shrubs is made, and the clothing 
and implements of the hunter are thoroughly smoked in it. The 
key block of the snow-house is at the same time scored in all
