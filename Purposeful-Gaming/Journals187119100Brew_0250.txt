1886
(Oct. 23)
Lake Umbagog, Maine
was sitting on the ground on a knoll. He also shot a common
Ruffed Grouse. I shot a Kin Fisher and three Canada Jays,
one of which escaped after I had almost caught him. I also
saw and shot at a Winter Wren. Heard Pine Grossbeaks twice
and Redpolls once. Only other birds six Parus hudsonicus (four
in one flock, two in another). Tree Sparrows along  the brook
in alders, a mixed flock of Chickadees, Kinglets, (satrapa) and
two Nuthatches (canadensis) and one or two Blue Jays. The
swamp was a dense growth of larches, white spruces, and arbor-
vitae, ground open beneath and carpeted with green moss.
  Reached the Lake House in the twilight. Went down on the 
meadow and heard and Owl calling at regular intervals in a smarl-
stub across the river. It looked as large as a Bubo. It was
calling at 11 o'clcock [o'clock] P.M. and near daybreak the next morn-
ing. (I now know that it was a Bubo virginianus - 1889)

  Sunday. Clear with a chilling east wind. Spent the day in
the house. Saw a flock of about a dozen small waders (pro-
ably T. bonapartii) circling over the marshes. Gerrish saw
a flock of about seventy-five Snow Buntings. In the evening
paddled down river in search of the Owl, but failed to either
see or hear him.

  Cloudy with occasional light showers.
  Lake calm nearly all day
  Started at about ten o'clcok [o'clock] in the forenoon and spent the
day on the Lake, going up to the head of Great Cove. A single
Duck off Great Island. It proved to be a wing-broken Coot (Oe.
americana)  After a long chase and several snap shots we fin-
ally captured it. Lunched on the west side of the Cove. I fol-
lowed a path through to the Thurston's clearing where I shot
a Blue Jay

  Afternoon spent at the head of the Cove. Started nine Shel-
drake and twelve Black Ducks, but fired only one long shot at
a Sheldrake. Saw a single Great Blue Heron.
