1888
May 30
Oden, Michigan
Clear and rather cool. Wind W.
  Spent the forenoon in a fruitless quest for
Pigeons. Entering the old woods beyond the hillside
clearing we penetrated through them coming out
on the state road.
  Dwight found the nest of a Hermit Thrush with
four fresh eggs, one distinctly spotted with brown.
I shot one of the birds.
  In some hardwood timber near the State Road
I found a nest of Hyd[?]hs ludoviciana in a
remarkable position viz in the extreme top of
a leafless beech fully 40ft. above the ground. I
took it, at first, for a Pigeon's nest but as I was
looking at it the [male] grosbeak entered it with a
twig in his bill which he proceeded to put in place.
  Heard a Turdus fuscuscens singing in hard wood
growth near a wood path but failed to get a shot
or even a fair sight at him.
  In the afternoon as we were packing a Contopus
borealis appeared in the clearing within a few rods
of the house. I heard him calling and at once
went in pursuit finally killing him on the telegraph
wire over the railroad and with my second barrel
shooting a [female] Geothlypis philadelphis that started
up from the ground and alighted in a fallen tree
top.
  Note We left Oden early in the morning of May 31st
and went directly through to New York without stopping.
Thus my journal of our trip in Michigan ends
with the above date.
