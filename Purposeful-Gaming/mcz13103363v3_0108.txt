  Clear and a beautiful day
but very warm. Ther. 
about 60弉��80弉��70�.
Rose at 3 A.M. went up & got
Charlie & we went over to
the marshes on Charles river
getting there as it was getting
light. Fired fourteen times
& shot 3 spotted & 4 least
sandpipers. C. Carter shot one
spotted & 1 least sandp[iper]. Got
home at 8.30 A.M. Got some
breakfast, plucked the peeps,
& stuffed both the Vir[ginia] rails shot
yesterday. Slept from 4 P.M.
to nearly 7 P.M. Father then carried
me up to Belmont & I got the
m[ea]d[ow] lark's found yesterday.
Went up to see C. Carter after
supper.

Wednesday, July 24, 1867.
  Clear but uncomfortably
warm. Good breeze most
of the day. Ther. about
75弉��88弉��76�. Rose
only in time for breakfast.
My poison probably
reached its height by
evening. In A.M. blew
three of the m[ea]d[ow] larks eggs
found Monday and
studied about two hours.
Also copied a part of my
eggs from my diary.
Slept from 4 P.M. to 5.45
P.M. Then took a ride
with father up to Mt Auburn
& up & down by the river.
Spent most of the evening
enjoying the cool breeze in
front of the house.
