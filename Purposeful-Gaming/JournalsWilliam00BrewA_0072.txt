a large White Egret. It flapped on ahead of me
for some distance frequently alighting. I could
have shot it easily enough but it had poor
plumes [?] and I did not care for it. I killed
another Yellow crown on this creek. Going only
a short distance beyond where I stopped yesterday
I came in sight of the Suwanee [into?] which
this large creek proved to flow.
  I then returned by the same route. Shot at
a Yellow crowned Heron at the entrance to Vista
Creek and missed or only wounded it. The
report of the gun started an Ivory-billed
Woodpecker which uttered its trumpet note a
dozen times or more. It was several hundred
yards off apparently. I turned back and 
paddled hard but it stopped calling and I 
failed to find it.
  Near the lower end of Vista Creek a White Ibis
flew from a cypress uttering a coarse rough call
(cr-r-r-r) and alighted again in another cypress.
I paddled to within about 50 yds. & fired just
as it opened its wings to start. It flew out
of sight up the connecting creek. I followed &
found it floating dead in mid stream.
  On the way down to the main creek I
started three Yellow crowned Herons and heard
a fourth crying out every few seconds [squaw?]
in harsh piercing tones. It proved to be my tame
gray bird which was sitting in an ash over
the water.
  Paddling down the creek I found Dr. Allen[?} near
its mouth & just outside Chapman. King Rails (?)
calling in the marsh where I shot the alligator.
