1888
Sept 27.
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Clear and warm wind S. W. light. Just
after breakfast shot a Grouse on the path
to the spring. Then started (7 A. M.) for
Androscoggin meadows In Sweat Mead-
ow found three Black Ducks but they saw
us and rose wild. Thence into Curtis Mead-
ow. About 50 Black Ducks scattered about
some feeding others on mud banks sun-
ning. Stalked three and getting them to-
gether shot both barrels but did not stop
a bird. Found on rising out of the grass
that they had been too far off. Others
came down by me and I dropped one/
Lunched at head of meadow. Returning
a large flock of Black Ducks rose from
the grass. I shot into them and drop-
ped one fully 75 yds. off. Thence to
Long Meadow. About a dozen Black
Ducks feeding in the grass. Stalked
them and stopped two firing only
one barrel. Both birds got into the grass
where "Don" quickly found them.
