1890
March 20
Suwanee River, Florida
Clear and warm. A dense fog at daybreak.
  Chapman and du [?Bose] (the [?cracker] hunter)
started out at dawn and found a heronry of
A. wardii in some cypress ponds about 3/4 mile
inland. There were about 100 nests with young. 
They also started about 25 Snipe, heard some 
Sand-hill Cranes and shot four Peucaea aestivalis
in the pine woods between the ponds and the river. 
  After breakfast I went out with Chapman
crossing the river and landing a little below
the point opposite the Bluffs. Found a large
cypress swamp separated from the river by a
narrow dry ridge wooded with water oaks, 
[?] [?], red maples, hackberry etc. The
deciduous trees just leafing out, many of them
badly [?touched] by the recent frosts.
  Cardinals, Carolina Wrens, Tufted Tits, Parulas, &
Yellow-throated Warblers were in full song on
every side. Pileated, Red-bellied and Red-headed
Woodpeckers were drumming & calling far & near.
The [?] started a Barred Owl which flapped
heavily off a few [?rods] and alighted again
when I shot it (I was unable to skin it
afterwards for lack of time). Chapman then
left me and I turned my attention to the 
ridge along the river. Found a large mixed
flock of Warblers chiefly Yellow rumps and 
Parulas with a sprinkling of Black and white
Creepers, [?Great] catchers & a Solitary [?] or two,
catching flies in a sunny [?spinney]. Among
these I soon made out a bird which I 
at once suspected to be a Bachman's Warbler &
