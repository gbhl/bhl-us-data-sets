1886
July 9
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and cool with light S. wind.
  In the afternoon paddled down to Ball's Hill
and sailed part of the way back.

  I went especially for Swallows and got 
seven, killing them with my 32 cal. pistol and 
five of them flying. They were out over the 
river in great numbers, especially at sunset.
Most of them were Barn Swallows, the majority
young birds, now strong on the wing and 
difficult to distinguish from the adults. There
were also many Bank Swallows, a few 
Cliff Swallows, a Martin or two, and twenty
of Swifts. In one place there must have been 
over a hundred of them fun species in flight
at once. I saw only three or four White-bellies.

  As I came up the river I disturbed larger
numbers of Red-wings going to roost in 
the grass (Phaleris) or Lisania along the banks.
They rose in clouds, chatting loudly. The 
majority were young birds.
[margin]Blackbirds flocking[/margin]
  The singing of birds is now rapidly
declining. At sunset, however, I heard in full
song Mimus Carolinensis, Turdus migratorius, Dendroica
aestiva (only one), Vireo Olivaceus, Cassareulus savanna,
Poocetus Granimucues, Spisilla Pusilla, Melosphira uloda,
M. Palustris (only one), and [?] americanus.
Cedar Birds numerous along the river, catching flies.
[margin]Birds still singing[/margin]
  New Jersey tea in full flower on hillsides, chickory
and St. Johnswort by roadsides. Silky corsul, wild
roses, and swamp azalea fast going out of bloom.
Bull frogs and green frogs still singing. One Rufo trilling last night.
