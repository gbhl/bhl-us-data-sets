keeping close along the line of rocky beach they passed us within good
range and I dropped one with each barrel.

  For several miles we poled the canoe along a sandy shore
the water shoal with sandy bottom scored by the trails of
numerous mussels. I noticed that they were rarely straight but
oftenest loop-shaped.

  On the extremity of Moose Point, now are extensive flats of 
oozy, treacherous mud, we found nine Golden Plover. They 
were scattered about feeding and seemed perfectly indifferent
to our approach. I got two [?] and killed both at
a shot. The others flew across to the Outlet where they
pitched down. Following them we found that they had
joined a larger flock which kept rising and alighting and 
finally mounted high in air and flew out of sight towards 
[?]. A single Bird remained on the flats & this I shot. 
  Landed just inside the mouth of the Outlet and lunched on
the banks making a fire & cooking a pair of Ducks. Hearing
a Yellow-Leg whistle we next started back in a search of him,
finding him on a large oozy flat at the outlet. On this flat
were also the Plover, about twenty-four or thirty in number. We
paddled within short gun-range but although they were all
about us for five or ten minutes I did not once succeed in 
getting two together. Finally I shot one sitting and another 
as it flew. The survivors mounted high in air and again
departed, this time for good. A Pectoral Sandpiper went off with 
them but the Yellow-leg and the Bonaparte's Sandpipers remained.
I killed the Yellow-leg first, making a very long cross shot, then
bagged the smaller birds. The latter were so tame that they
would not fly at the report of the guns.

  Rowed back to Lakeside without seeing anything much
except a single Scoter (the only one to-day) & about 12 Loons.
