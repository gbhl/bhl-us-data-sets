1886
Aug 5
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and cool.
  Spent two or three hours of the forenoon along
the river bank behind the Manse and on Ripley's Hill.
In the first-named locality I found a Water Thrush,
two Creepers (Mniotilta), and several Yellow Warblers one 
of the latter singing rather freely and quiet in the to
normal spring tones. Another Water Thrush darted
out from our corn field as I passed.

  On Ripley's HIll the pitch pine groove was fairly
alive with birds-a large mixed flock among which
were a pair of young Red-bellied Nuthatches, a 
Canada Warbler, several Pine Warblers, Least Fly catchers
and Wood Peewees, one Yellow Throated Vireo and a 
Blue Jay besides numerous Chipping Sparrow among
the shrubbery outside.

  In the second-growth on the east side were
several Warbling and Red-eyed Vireo, the former
feeding on the berries of Cornus alternifolia.
In this second growth I also startled a Wood cock
probably the same seen by Purdie a week or two ago.

  The singing of birds has now almost wholly
ceased. I have not heard a high Red-eye or 
Robin to-day and only one or two Long Sparrows.
A Meadow Lark however, is whistling on the 
meadow as I write (5:30 P.M.). It would be 
essentially correct, for this season at least, to say
that the singing of birds was at its highest through
June, gradually declining through July, and 
ended with August 1st.
Warblers migrating in some numbers last night. I heard
