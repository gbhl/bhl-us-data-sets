GEOLOGY OF ISLAND GROUP II. 
This group is comprised of the great island of Baffin, with 
Bylot island lying off its northeast corner, and the many smaller 
islands which lie as a fringe around both. 
Geological specimens from the east side of baffin were col- 
lected by the expedition under Ross and Parry, and were 
described by Dr. McCulloch. They consisted of loose specimens 
collected in two localities, and give little information. Speci- 
mens collected by Parry on the same coast were described by 
Koning as gneiss and micaceous quartz rock, also some ambig- 
uous granitic compound in which hornblende seems to enter as 
a subordinate ingredient. 
Dr. P. C. Sutherland, in 1853, describes the east coast of 
Baffin island between Lancaster sound and Cumberland gulf 
as follows: ' On the opposite shore (south) of Lancaster sound, 
at Cape Walter Bathurst, the crystalline rocks are again recog- 
nized, and from this point they occupy the whole coast south 
to Cumberland strait and probably considerably beyond it. To 
this, however, I believe there is one exception, at Cape Durban, 
on the 67th parallel, where coal has been found by Whalers; and 
also at Kingaite, two degrees to the southwest of Durban, where 
from the appearance of the land as viewed from a distance, trap 
may be said to Occur on both sides of the inlet. Graphite is 
found abundant and pure in several islands situated on the 65th 
parallel of latitude, in Cumberland strait, and on the west side 
of Davis strait.' 
C. F. Hall brought home a considerable collection of rocks 
and minerals picked up during his explorations about Frobisher 
bay and the southeast coast of Baffin island. These were named 
by Prof. B. K. Emerson, and consist of ordinary Laurentian 
rocks, including granite, gneiss and schists. The minerals were 
magnetite, apatite, bornite and pyrite from Frobisher and 
Cyrus Field bays. Lower Silurian limestones were found in
