Ashby, Massachusetts
which is steep and rocky and sprinkled with young
spruces growing singly and in small clusters,
we found a Yellow Rumped Warbler and a Snow
Bird. In the woods above and well up on the
mountain side, and probably near where we
spent yesterday afternoon, I heard a flock of
Crossbills piping, but did not see any of
them. A Red-tailed Hawk was circling far
sometimes over the top of the mountain, pur-
sued by a mob and angry Crows. We reached
home at about the usual time.
