Pintail, an old [male] with long tail, one Mergus serrator &
a few Whistlers.
  There were many Waders flying to-day, a few
alighting on a mud bank opposite my stand.
I saw fully 100 Willets, about a dozen Greater Yellow-legs,
a flock of about 10 Stilt Sandpipers, several flocks 
of Aegialites semipalenata, an oyster Catcher, a
Marbled(?) Godwit, and a few flocks of Peeps (species
not ascertained).
  Royal Terns were numerous and I might
have shot a dozen from my stand. Two
Forster's Terns came and fished near me
giving me a good view at them.
  Late in the afternoon two Ardea wardi
came and fished in the shallows below
my stand. I shot at them at very long
range (nearly 100 yds.) but got neither.
  In the grass near the stand, I flushed
a Carolina Rail which looked like an adult
in full breeding plumage.
  The day was so rough & stormy that I
heard no small birds except a Carolina Wren
just at evening.
  Several great beds of Coots lay in the bay
opposite my stand all day. When started
buy the boat they would rise lightly & easily
against the strong wind, some of them
getting as high as 50 ft. in going 100 yds.
They had a curious hovering flight reminding
me of Pigeons about to alight. Although
there were many thousands I heard them
cry out only a few times. They made a curious
murmur very like the cry of the muskrat.
