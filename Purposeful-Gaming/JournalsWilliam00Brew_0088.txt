1888
(June 13)
  In the afternoon started out again this time to the
eastward of the house. We visited the locality where
the Kinglets were found last year but the best of it
has been since stripped of its trees and there were
few birds there. On the opposite (western) side of
the railroad, however, we found a nest of Spizella soc.
with 3 eggs & one of an Oven-bird with 5 eggs both far
advanced in incubation. A D. blackburniae, several
D. virens, a V. solitarius, several V. olivaceus, a Helminth
ruficapilla and a Junco hyemalis were either seen or
heard in the woods.
  Early this morning - about daybreak - we were all
awakened by a Whippoorwill which sang thirty or forty
times on the door-step directly below the window.
A distinct chuck preceded each utterance. Bailey
says that this bird regularly sings on this doorstep
every morning excepting when the weather is cold
or stormy. He was often watched him and seen
him dart out after passing moths returning, after
catching his prey, to resume his song which
is interrupted frequently in this way.

  Rained hard most of the day. Late in the afternoon I
took a walk down the lane that passes the house.
A pair of Kinglets in the spruce swamp by the brook.
A Swamp Sparrow singing in the meadow. Mosquitoes
very numerous and ferocious.
