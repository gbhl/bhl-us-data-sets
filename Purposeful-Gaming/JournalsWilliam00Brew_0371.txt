1889
Sept. 12
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Clear and warm. Wind N.E. Dense haze all day.
  Woodcock shooting in the morning riding about half- 
way to Upton on the buckboard with C.& E. and
walking back. Beat some ground new to me, a hillside
pasture filled with young spruces between the road
and the Lake. Near the bottom of this slope on
the edge of a wet swale among arbor-vitae I lost
Don and presently found him on a staunch point.
As I stepped up behind him two Woodcock rose
and I killed them right & left with the little
20 gauge. These were all that I saw.

  Saw many small birds. Flickers numerous especially  
in a pasture where they were hopping about on the
ground with Robins. In thickets near the roadside
saw three D. caerulescens, two D. virens, two Helminthophila
ruficapilla and one Parula. Also five G. trichas, one
an adult [male].

  Immediately after dinner I took advantage of the 
strong S.E. wind and started up the Lake in my
Rushton canoe. Sailed to Moll's Rock in about an hour
and a half. Saw almost nothing on the way except
a pair of Bald Eagles, one a superb adult, playing 
together in the air over Great Island just as a
pair of Buteos will often play, one rising above
the other and swooping down past it. I saw three
other single Eagles and one Osprey. Heard a Loon 
utter the long-drawn er-loo with sometimes a third
syllable given in a rising falsetto tone the whole
er-loo-ee. I looked closely for Phalaropes but
saw none.
