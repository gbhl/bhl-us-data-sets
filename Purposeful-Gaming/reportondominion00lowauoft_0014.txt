In the preparation of this report, I have received much valu- 
able assistance from Dr. robert Bell, Acting Director of the 
Geological Survey, who has not only helped personally, but 
who also kindly allowed the very necessary assistance of the 
following members of the staff of that department : Mr. J. M. 
Macoun, who named and described the plants in the collections 
brought home; Mr. L. Lambe and Dr. H. M. Ami, who 
determined and named the collections of fossils, and Mr. F. 
Nicolas, who kindly edited the report and prepared the index 
to it. .The map which accompanies the report was prepared 
under the direction of Mr. C. O. senecal by Messrs. C. F. King 
and P. Frereault. 
My thanks are due to Mr. W. McMahon, Superintendent of 
Printing, for his kindly advice and assistance in the publica- 
tion of this report, and it is entirely due to him that the volume 
presents its creditable appearance. 
I have the honour to be, sir, 
Your humble servant, 
A. P. LOW.
