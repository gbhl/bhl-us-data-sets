1888
June 16
Winchendon, Massachusetts.
Clear and cooler with high N. W. wind.
  Started rather early and made a long day in
the woods not getting in until sunset. Went through
the lane, then north along the road with which
it connects, then into a spruce swamp and home
across country through an almost unbroken & for the
most part very dense woods.
  In the spruce swamp heard Blackburnians & a Kinglet
but after spending at least two hours searching we
had to leave the place without having found a nest 
of any kind. In some tall paper birches saw a pair
of Hairy Woodpeckers which, as we approached, set up a
great clamor. After searching for their nest I finally
saw one of them feed a young bird which was perched
on one of the upper branches of the tree. I heard other
young calling but could not find them. The mosquitos
were very troublesome in this place & we had to build
smudges whenever we halted for any length of time.
  Penetrating through a grove of young white pines & crossing
a pasture we entered a dense spruce woods where the
trees stood so thickly as to shut out nearly every ray of
sunlight. The ground beneath was smooth & carpeted with
brown needles. Here we lunched and looked carefully
for nests. Hearing a Kinglet sing we went in pursuit
& found a pair the [female] of which was collecting material
for her nest. In a very few minutes we traced her
to it. It was some 40 ft. up in a large, dense spruce
near the extremity of a branch under which it hung
not unlike a Vireo's nest. Bailey climbed to it & found
it nearly finished. Both birds darted into & out of it
as soon as he descended. In the same woods
