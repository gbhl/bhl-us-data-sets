1886
(Nov. 8)
interesting specimens intermediate both in the gray
and red phases. Chadbourne took and killed him
after we had photographed him sitting in the
entrance of a hole. He was stupid and lethargic
as usual.
  The fields are still green but the woods are
almost perfectly bare of leaves.
  We saw only one Hawk, a Buteo borealis  
sailing high in air over the woods.
