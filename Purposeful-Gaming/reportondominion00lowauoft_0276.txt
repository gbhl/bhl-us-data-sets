174 CRUISE OF THE NEPTUNE 
was only prevented by considerable force. He was finally 
ejected, and pursued by the other angekok, who could be heard 
chasing the walrus several times over the iglo. A violent 
struggle ensued. The pursuer returned to the iglo a few 
minutes later with his hands and arms covered with blood,

shredded it fine, after which it was placed in a new clay pipe, 
lighted, and passed round the assembly.

amusement, and men, women and children join in kicking 
about the ice a ball of feathers or deer hair covered with deer- 
skin. There do not appear to be any rules, each playing for 
himself. There is another ball game, where the ball is batted
