when I went to bed.
  This flight, which largely exceeded any previous
flight noted this year, suspicious were from the 
fact that it apparently started when the conditions
for a nocturnal migration were highly unfavorable,
the night being very dark and the haze so closer
that the stars, as well as all distant objects on 
the earth, were wholly obscured. Probably, however, 
the haze lay very near the ground or was of
local distribution only.
  Another feature of equally unusual occurrence
as far as my experience goes was that these
birds started in larger numbers as far as it
became fairly dark. Usually they do not begin
to fly before from one to two hours after dark sets
in.
