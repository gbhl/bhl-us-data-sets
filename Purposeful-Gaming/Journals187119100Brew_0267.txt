Pigeon Hawk darted past in pursuit of a
Robin & missing its prey alighted in the very
middle of one of the white maples. It started
out just as we got within good range giving
Spelman a fair cross shot but the sail was
in his way and he made a clean miss.
  We next landed at Dakin's Hill and
I spent an hour o more basking in the sun
under the lee of the pines while Spelman
took a long tramp inland. I shot a Pine
Warbler and a Bluebird. S. came back with
a Tree Sparrow. He saw a fox and flushed
a bevy of about eighteen Quail in a stubble.
We found the fox's "earth" with fresh tracks
leading out but were returning.
  Our next stage by boat was the final one
and we reached the Manse before sunset.
After housing the boat we rambled up over
Ripley's Hill flushing a Grouse on the east slope
and getting a fine view of the flooded meadows.
  Returning there was still a short space of time
before the sunset. Birds were singing on every
side, a robin in the orchard, Redwings in
the oaks by the river, Song Sparrows in
various directions, and a Meadow Lark
somewhere in the distance. The wind had
died away and the water was so smooth
that the furrow of a muskrat crossing
the channel just below the Rd bridge
was distinctly marked.
  Grouse have roosted regularly all winter
long in the pines at the north end of the
