that uses up oxygen, goes on without regard to light. 
For this reason, cloudy weather is much more danger- 
ous than clear for flooding the bogs in their season of 
active growth. 
The days of our June floodings are about the long- 
est in the year. In clear weather, they allow photosyn- 
thesis to go on about fifteen hours of the twenty-four, 
the oxygen in the water thus being replenished three- 
fifths of the time. 
Judging by what is known about the effect of 
temperature with other species, a rise of 18 degrees F. 
increases the rate of respiration in the new growth of 
the cranberry fully 100 per cent. It seems from this 
that a combination of very cloudy weather with a high 
water temperature is especially dangerous in the flood- 
ing of the vines while they are actively growing, for, 
while the stopping of photosynthesis allows the oxygen 
content of the water to become greatly reduced, the 
high temperature greatly increases the need of the 
plants for oxygen. This was the weather combination 
of June 17. As already stated, the day was darkly 
cloudy. It was also warm for a cloudy day, the tem- 
perature at the state bog reaching 77 degrees F. Also, 
as the 14th, 15th and 16th had been warm days and 
with warm nights, the water must have become quite 
warm before it was put on the bog. 
WATER INJURIES TO CRANBERRY BUDS 
When, in flooding, cranberry blossom buds are 
hurt by drowning (lack of oxygen), they usually are 
either entirely killed, the whole bud turning brown 
and never opening, or they are injured only on one 
side, in which case the point of the bud soon bends 
toward the hurt side and one or two lobes of the corolla 
very often turn entirely brown. When but one side of 
the bud is hurt, it usually opens to form an imperfect 
blossom, but only very rarely develops a berry. When 
this drowning injury occurs, the buds are hurt most in 
the deepest water and on the sides of the ditches. 
Another kind of bud injury, connected with the 
flooding of a chain of three bogs located near together, 
was observed this season. The variety of berries on 
all these bogs is the Early Black and the water for 
flooding them all comes from the same source. All 
three bogs were flooded before sunrise June 12. The
