INFLUENCE OF THE WIND 37 
cranks, and improvers of their kind generally; but 
here the individual reformer can find no disciple; 
he is one against an incalculable multitude all wound 
up to keep on the old bad way so that his better way 
inevitably comes to an end with himself. 
Imagination was not the right word, at all events 
in its restricted sense, while the other phrase of the 
constant intuition of snow suggests that these world- 
wide physical effects are due principally to a purely 
psychical cause. Well, I don't find it impossible to 
believe that. One always wants to find something 
to believe, some way out of the maze, for we do know 
that in the lower animals, as in man, the mind does 
react on the organism sometimes with tremendous 
power, to the production of strange results, as we 
see, for example, in cases of pre-natal suggestion. 
However, just now we are concerned mainly with 
the atmospheric sense, and particularly with the 
influence of the wind. 
While classing myself as an ordinary outdoor 
natural man, tolerant, and more than tolerant, of all 
weathers and Nature's influence in all her moods 
and manifestations, I yet fear when coming back to 
this subject that I shall find no support in anything 
said by others in what remains to be told. There is, 
then, nothing but my own personal experience, and as 
every face of man and every mind differs from every 
other face and every other mind, so it may be that 
the wind, when it visits me, tells me a story some- 
what different from the thousands and millions of 
stories it has told and tells to others.
