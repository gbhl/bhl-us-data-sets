For drains three feet deep and at a uniform distance of one hun- 
dred feet apart, the cost should not exceed fifteen dollars per acre. 
While the proper distance between drains can be accurately ascer- 
tained only by experiment, yet it is our judgment that a distance of 
one hundred feet between drains could frequently be increased and 
would seldom require to be decreased. In addition to the above, 
there would be the cost of constructing outlets to conduct the water 
to the lake or river. For this area, the expense would be compara- 
tively small, on account of the long draws that now extend back into 
the land like irrigation canals. These may require deepening and 
supplementing in places. 
In order to be carried out in the most economical way, drainage 
should be made a community affair, and the systems should be plan- 
ned with reference to a general scheme, especially Where a large 
number of land owners are involved.
