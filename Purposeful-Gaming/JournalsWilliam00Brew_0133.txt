1888
Sept 23
Lake Umbagog, Maine
Clear and cool with high N. W. wind. The
first clear day for a week. Started at 8 A. M.
with Hill and Skillings for the Megalloway.
Off Moll's Rock a Pigeon Hawk passed me
at long range I fired both barrels wound-
ing it with the first but but it kept on over
the woods. At Moll's Carry heard a Sparrow
calling whit. whit. like a Least Flycatcher
Shot it and found it to be a juv. Zon.
leucophrys. Ascending the Megalloway
saw nothing save a Kingfisher or two
looked into every pond hole but found
nothing until we reached Bottle Brook
pond in which was about 20 Black
Ducks. Skillings and I took stands and
Hill stalked them getting a long shot
only, and killed but one. While eating
lunch on the river bank we saw 14
Black Ducks circle and drop into the
pond. I stalked them but they swam
across to Hill's stand. His first barrel
missed fire, he failed to kill as they rose
with this second. Four passed me with-
in long shot. I missed with both barrels.
Got in another shell just in time for some
more Ducks but only wounded my bird
badly. He dropped so far in the woods
that we did not look for him. Reached
Moose Point at sunset and lay there till
dark. No shots. Several flocks of Ducks passed
high. Three Snipe heard, also a Night Heron.
