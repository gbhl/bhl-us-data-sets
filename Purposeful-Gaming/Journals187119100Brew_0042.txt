1886
May 19
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear, rather cool with high N. Wind.
Spent the morning on the East side of the Lime Kiln
road. Birds very abundant, many of them emigrants
scattered about and hard to find, owing to the
wind. Shot a Fon. leucophiys in a brush heap
bordering the road along a wall, but could not
find him.
  A great change in the woods since
yesterday, many of the trees dark with leaves.
