at length the leaves moved at the very top of
the tree and a golden head and breast
gleaned for an instant in the sunlight. The 
next the pistol cracked and down came my
proven fluttering nosily through the tangled branches
and gave vines that interlaced them. When
I reached the spot I found him lying breast
up, respectfully dead, covered with blood and with
a patch of feathers, gone from this throat. Careful
cherishing and stitch at the ban place turned
him into a very good specimen however.
  After this accomplishing the object of my 
trip I shot thru one birds (two Yellow Warblers and 
a Nashville) and returned about noon.
  In the afternoon I spent an hour on
Ripley's Hill where I found a small mixed
flock on the eastern slope and killed a fine
adult male Creeper (Minostitta) and ad. female D. Coronata and 
two D. pennslyvania.
  Then are few birds about the Manse now all
or nearly all, the locality does not seem to attract
migrate. To-day, however, I saw a D. Vireo in 
the ash trees over the avenue. Early this morning
a Vireo flavifrous was singing somewhere near the 
hours. Orioles I neither see nor hear now except
in the woods and occasionally along the river.
The Chimney Swifts careering over the house at 
sunset are about all the remains of Spring
and early numbers bird neighbors. Our catbird
left now than a week ago.
  A brilliant aurora this evening. No Warblers migrating
