wing. It made off at a wonderful pace by a succession
of long leaps but finally stood "at bay" as we landed &
approached it. It proved a female in ragged, dull plumage.
Its mate which we afterwards saw again was probably
the author of the cucking cry.
  On the island opposite, a Regulus calendula was singing
superbly as we were passing. We also found five or six
R. satrapa in the pines on the hill.
  Landing we went over nearly the same ground as
that covered last week. Shot a D. palmarum and saw
many common birds including a Cuthia. Lunched under
the shelter of some pines. The sky had clouded over & a
chill east wind was now blowing.
  As we left the shore again in our boat a pair of
Black Ducks passed flying up river. Well out from land
a muskrat floated showing his full length, tail & all;
a huge fellow grown wary too by long experience.
  Made our last landing at the hill below Ball's &
after a short tramp lay down on the west side of a slope
covered with pines. Sun out again, clear & warm. Bluebirds
& Juncos warbling in one orchard, Grassfinches singing, Flickers
laughing, a Pine Warbler or two trilling. A Marsh Hawk (male)
passed & I "squeaked" him within a good range but missed.
  Two boys in a boat above Ball's Hill fired several shots in
quick succession & soon fifteen Gooseanders passed high over-
head, seven in one flock, eight in another, only one drake
among them all. (A fine male in the window of a provision
store in Concord evidently a victim of 
Fast-day gunners).
  Sailed part way home & rowed the remainder. Redwings
on all sides singing merrily. About fifteen Swallows (T. bicolor)
over the water. Robins singing everywhere.
  The water lower than last week but still well over the meadows.
