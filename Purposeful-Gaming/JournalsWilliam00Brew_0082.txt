her out into a field where she descended to the ground
in search of building material. While watching
her heard a House Wren singing in a neighboring
orchard.
  Returning to the buggy drove on nearly through
the street and tied again near the low pines. Two
Prairie Warblers singing here, one in the spring glen
to the south. Searched for their nests in vain for
nearly two hours and finally after losing all hope
and when on our way back to the buggy I
found one in a low barberry clump just north
of the lane opposite the pine. The [female] was sitting
on a fine set of five nearly fresh eggs.
  Within 20 ft. of the buggy I found a nest of
Dend. pennsylvanica with two eggs. It was in a
poplar sapling but in a clump of hazel.
  Drove home by way of the mill-pond
road and Waverly. On the hillside below the
engine house heard a Meadow Lark whistling.
One was seen there last year. Warbling Vireos
and Orioles heard rather frequently as far down
as Mt. Auburn. Denton heard a Bobolink
near Brown's at the willows cross roads.
