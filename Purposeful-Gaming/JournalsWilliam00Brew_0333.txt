1889
June 20
Watertown, Mass.
Clear and warm with light S. W. wind.
  At 4 P. M. took horse car to Mt. Auburn and with
Denton went over the Coolidge farm looking for Cedar Birds'
nests. We found none nor, indeed, anything except a
Flicker's which we did not open although the bird flew
from it. Many young birds were out, among them
Orioles & Redstarts. Few birds singing in the apple orchard
or on French's Hill except Red-eyes and an occasional
Robin.
  Denton left me at French's Hill and I kept on alone
down into the valley to the S. W. and thence up the
brook to Hog's Back ridge. In the alder swamp east
of this ridge Red-wings were singing about a little
strip of meadow. There were also a Cat-bird a 
Maryland Yellow-throat and several Song Sparrows in
full song. On the ridge a Grosbeak was singing
listlessly. A King-bird sitting on its nest in the top
of a pitch pine. A Pine Warbler singing faintly & briefly.
Near the railroad an Indigo Bird in full song.
  Crossing the track & passing through the oak woods
I heard nothing but a Wood Pewee until I reached
the further woods where the same Crow seen on
my last visit again met me and followed me
with great clamor. An Indigo Bird singing near
the brook, a Grass Finch in the open field.
  Keeping on up the brook I entered the great field
to the west. As I crossed it I aroused no less
than two pairs each of Bobolinks & Meadow Larks.
The former evidently had young, the latter were
as shy & reserved as usual. In the scattered oaks
in this field Wood Pewees & a Vireo flavifrons
