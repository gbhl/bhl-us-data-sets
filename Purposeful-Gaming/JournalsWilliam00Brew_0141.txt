1888
Sept. 28.
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Clear and colder with high N. W. wind.
Started early for the Androscoggin Mead-
ows. Just below the Megalloway had a
good shot at a fine adult Broad-wing-
ed Hawk sitting on a stub but missed
with both barrels. Entered Curtis Mead-
ow. Stone and Doyle taking the
Meadow. They found about 100 Black
Ducks there and bagged two. We did
not get a bird all day and I had
only one shot at a Black Duck which
rose from the grass. I wounded her
badly and she dropped in the woods
but we did not follow her. We saw
less than a dozen Black Ducks in all.
Spent most of the day in a brush stand
which we improvised to shield us
and the boat. The water has risen
about two feet since the last rains.
Autumn coloring now superb.
