Waltham & Belmont, Mass.
time is certainly a scant showing. Where can the
northern birds be?
  The country is now well filled with summer residents.
In the runs behind the Warren place, Red starts, Red-
eyed Vireos, Wilson's Thrushes, Cat Birds & such common
birds were numerous. I also heard two Tanagers and
three Grosbeaks here but not a single Golden winged
Warbler. Nashville Warblers were not numerous. I heard
only one [male] singing but saw two more, a pair which
seemed to be hunting for a good nesting site. 
  Two Red-shouldered Hawks were circling over the
woods, high in air, screaming incessantly. Saw a 
Hummingbird (my first this year) prising in front
of a large cedar apple "blossom", evidently puzzled by its
singular composition. There were fewer Thrashers than
on the 7th when I last visited this ground. Heard
one Field Sparrow & one Grass Finch; also Purple Martins
warbling high overhead. Two toads trilling on the
edge of a pond. Chestnut sided Warblers a few.
  In the Willows saw only a few Song Sparrows, Yellow
Warblers & Red-wings. Bobolinks singing all over the
meadow. during my [delete]entire[/delete] drive to-day I heard
fourteen different [males?] of this species.
  The Short-billed Marsh Wrens have returned to Rock
Meadow. Faxon heard six different birds there
in one day this week and four this morning. There
was a Bittern jumping in April but he has not
been heard this month. A few Carolina & Virginia
Rails but no Marsh Hawks this year. One White-eyed
Vireo on the oak knoll. As many red-wings as usual.
  Jack-in-the-pulpit & Columbines in full bloom
Viola pedata past its prime.
