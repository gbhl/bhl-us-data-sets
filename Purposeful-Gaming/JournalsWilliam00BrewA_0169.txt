1890
June 24
Falmouth, Massachusetts.
  Cloudy with the sun shining dimly at intervals, a gray day 
with light SW wind and deliciously soft air.
  Came to Falmouth last night and started off this
morning in an open buggy with C. driving over to the West
Falmouth marshes. Our way led for several miles through
oak woods interspersed with open country in farms or
pastures grown up to blueberry and huckberry bushes with 
occasional swampy thickets. Rhus copallina one of the most
abundant shrubs along the roadside. Wild roses in full
bloom and apparently larger and deeper in color than at home. 
Birds about as numerous as in Middlesex County but the
relative numbers of the different species varying somewhat
of course. Meadow Larks, Quail, and Grass Finches singing in
the fields, Red-wings about the swamps, Maryland Yellow-throats 
and Cat-birds in swampy thickets, Prairie Warblers (heard 3 [males]), Chestnut-sided
and Yellow Warblers along the wood edges, Oven-birds, [?], and
Red-eyed Vireos in the oak scrub, Song Sparrows and Robins 
everywhere. Some Grackles and a Wood Pewee in the town. No
White-eyed, Warbling or Yellow-throated Vireos or Grosbeaks or 
Tanagers anywhere noted. A small colony of Purple Martins
in the town and Barn and White-bellied Swallows skimming 
the fields and marshes.

  On reaching the salt marshes found Savanna Sparrows and
Red-wings along their edges and in coves when they 
made back into the hills but the middle of these marshes
seemed wholly without breeding birds of any species although
there were numerous ponds and ditches the edges of 
which afforded excellent ground for Sharp-tailed Finches
for which I searched closely but in vain. Song Sparrows
were numerous in thickets of bay-berry [?] with [?] 
along the edges of these marshes and in the hollows
