(May 28)
intervals near the middle of the meadows.
No Rails calling although the weather was 
most favorable.
  Returning saw a Night Heron in brown or rather 
dirty gray plumage. He filled from perch
to perch alighting low down in the willows
over the water allowing me to get within
about thirty yards.
  Bobolinks and Orioles singing along the
banks. Also a few Meadow Larks; No Savanna
Sparrows. Water plants fast forming beds
at the surface and impeding migration.
