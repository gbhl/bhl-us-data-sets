of the animal seems to be the matter of supreme moment. 
Linville and Kelly, the text most widely used now, is to be 
classed with this group. Davenport's Introduction to Zoology 
seems to swing back toward the old natural history point of 
View, emphasizing external features, especially those that re- 
late to habits, in other words it takes the ecological view point. 
While not the most recent therefore, it may be looked upon 
as marking, perhaps, the most advanced stand in modern 
zoology. In the very recent books there is an evident ten- 
dency to include a good deal of practical or economical ma- 
terial; this is especially true in Davidson, but not as true in the 
Daugherty's Economic Zoology, although its name would in- 
dicate that the effort of the book is to stress this particular 
phase. 
It is very evident from this abstract of the complete table 
and much more evident from the complete table itself, that 
the texts in zoology are far from indicating any unanimity of 
opinion as to the proper content of a high school zoology 
course. 
PROGRESS OF SECONDARY SCHOOL AGRI- 
CULTURE IN ILLINOIS 
A. W. NOLAN, UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS 
Agricultural teaching in the secondary schools of Illinois 
has not spread so rapidly as it has in many other states, but 
the growth of this phase of vocational education in the state 
has been sane and progressive. Two years ago there were 
thirty-two high schools in the state giving instruction in ag- 
riculture; the number has probably been doubled by this time. 
The length of term given to agriculture in most cases is 
one year, many schools are offering two years by alternating 
courses and giving only one course each year. Only three 
schools to my knowledge are offering four-year courses in 
agriculture. Four or five schools offer special short courses 
during the winter for boys and girls who cannot attend school 
regularly. 
The year of agriculture is usually given in the first year of 
high school and made elective to students in other classes. 
Warren's Elements of Agriculture is the text generally used.
