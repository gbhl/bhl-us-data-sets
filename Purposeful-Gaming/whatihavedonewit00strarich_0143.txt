THE CAT-BIRD 
always questioning and never seems to find a satisfactory answer. 
He never becomes accustomed to your presence about other nests, 
and this Seems pure perversity, for he will accept you near his 
own when he feels asSured that you are doing no damage. If 
hunger-pangs or family cares did not call him strongly, he would 
follow me all day, watching, questioning and interfering with 
What was happening to other birds.
