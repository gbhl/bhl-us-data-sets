1886 
June 28
Concord, Massachusetts.
Morning cloudy, afternnon clear; cool, wing, N.E., light.
  To the woods by the ice pond on the road
to Smith's in search of the Solitary vireo's nest. I
soon heard one of the birds whining and going
to the spot found him hopping about in a pine
low down. As I stood watching him the [female]
flew directly to the nest which was in the slender
birch sapling nearly over the spot when I had
stopped. The birds were putting the finishing 
touches on it and both entered it several times
while I was watching them, one bringing
a slender blade of grass and working it
into the lining, the other tinkering the outside
decorations.

and nest.[/margin]
  Leaving the vireos I spent the remainder
of the morning rambling through an 
extensive tract of dense but not heavy oak
and pine woods. I saw nothing of much
interest except a lazy brood of young Grouse
at least half grown and as wild as Hawks.
The mother was with them but although
she whined and clucked a little she kept
at a safe distance evidently realizing that
her young were pretty well able to take
care of themselves.
Pyrrhula in bloom everywhere. Azalia past
its prime.
