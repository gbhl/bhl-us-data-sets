(June7)  
sun was blazing down on the still water and
hardly a bird of any kind could be seen or heard.
Hence the stretch of meadow between the bridges, so
full of interest last evening, was to-day almost
devoid of visable or audible life.
  When I entered the large meadow below a gentle
breeze sprung up and I sailed most of the way
to the next bridge. The birds were more animated here
and I heard Marsh Wrens almost incessantly [?]
several Rails.  Without special effort I added  seven
more Wrens to my bag trying only for those that
were near the edge of the grass and getting nearly
all that I shot at. Near the foot of this meadow
I passed a Bittern that was "booming" steadily at
frequent intervals. I distinctly heard the preliminary
five [?] notes as I did, also, with one heard
last evening. I could still hear this bird long after
passing the next bridge at probably the distance
of a mile,.
  Landed for a drink at the pump (delicious
clean, cold water) Then started in earnest for
Concord, paddling with few pauses the entire
remaining distance. It was a most delightful
experience, the air still baking, warm, all bird
life at its best. Crossing Fairhaven I heard
the Whippoorwill at the lone pine, precisely where one
used to sing last summer. The one to-night merely
gave a succession of clucking notes just as the
sun was setting. A pair of Night-hawks playing
over the Hermit Thrush burnt ground, the [male] chasing the
[female] and booming. Another [?]ing over Egg Rock. A
Night Heron at Martha's Point. A Carolina Dove cooing in
the tall pines opposite the cliffs.  Home at 8 p.m.
