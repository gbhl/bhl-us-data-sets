1889
Oct. 14
Cloudy most of the day clearing late in p.m. Sunset was
fine, the air wonderfully clear, the mountains covered with
a rose-colored haze.
  At work on specimens most of the day. Took
a sail in the canoe late in p.m. Three Scoters (I 
think M. velvetina) passed me in the twilight
flying very swiftly close to the water.

Oct. 15
Cloudless with cool bracing N. wind and warm sunshine.
A perfect October day.
  At work on my birds until 3 p.m. when I took 
the little canoe and paddled to Leonard's Pond.
A few Tree Sparrows, Juncos & Chickadees there. At
sunset two small flocks of Black Ducks passed 
over going towards Moose Point. I followed them
but could not find them. The water has fallen 
more than a foot and the grass on Moose Point
marsh is appearing again. The musk rats have 
started a house there. I saw and heard at
least eight or ten of them some making the
peculiar murmuring call.

  This morning a Pileated Woodpecker called in 
the woods behind the camp. An Eagle also 
sailed over. Most of the small birds seem to have 
gone south. Even Chickadees & Kinglets are much
scarcer than they were a week ago. The leaves are
now nearly all down and the deciduous trees 
bare.
