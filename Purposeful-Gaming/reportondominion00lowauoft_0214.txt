134 cruise OF THE neptune 
tinent the Central Eskimos, to distinguish them from the 
natives of Greenland and from those of the western Arctic coast 
and Alaska. 
The following divisions are taken from Boas, with such 
modifications as have been found necessary. 
the numbers of the different divisions are in many instances 
only approximate, as it is exceedingly difficult to arrive at a 
correct census, even when actually on the ground, owing to the 
lack of appreciation of the natives of numbers and to their want 
of interest in such investigations.
