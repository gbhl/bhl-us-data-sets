152 ILLINOIS ACADEMY OF SCIENCE. 
It is impossible for a museum to work effectively without 
proper quarters. When needed space is provided, the exhibits 
which now represent the work of collection covering more than 
half a century, can become of great value to three classes of citi- 
zens: first, men of science who wish to use material (notably 
type specimens) for research work; second, men of business, 
who wish information concerning raw materials, and third, the 
casual Sightseer and even the unlettered man who, in the museum 
can find entertainment of the finest type. 
In the matter of collecting, the attitude of the present curator 
is that there is a vast field in the state yet uncovered by existing 
agencies, and that there is ample room for all institutions doing 
work of this character. The one care should be to see that for 
our own people are preserved records which otherwise would be 
transferred to other regions of the country or, far more unfor- 
tunately than that, lost to science entirely. The chief aim of the 
institution is to be of direct value to all who may be assisted. 
It should be in a position to represent the excellent work which 
is being done along scientific lines notable at the University of 
Illinois and by workers in other localities of the state. Situated 
at the center of the state geographically and at some distance 
from the great intellectual center which Chicago always will be, 
it has a large field of usefulness. 
Imperfect as the institution now is, it was visited last year by 
more than 31,000 people by actual count and judging by the in- 
crease in the early part of this year that number will probably 
approach 50,000 this year. 
Exhibits furnished by the State Geological Survey, State Ento- 
mologist, the Highway Commissioner, the Department of Soils, 
the Bureau of Mines, the Department of Health, etc., would be a 
means of spreading abroad concrete knowledge of the work along 
these lines. 
The museum being in a somewhat isolated position, may very 
well become a special protege of the State Academy of Science 
to the advantage of all concerned. And it is to be hoped that 
individually and collectively, the members of the organization will 
interest themselves in the furthering of the interests of the 
museum. Sixty members of the academy wrote clearly stated 
and urgent letters to the governor and legislators asking that a 
new building be provided at Springfield for the museum. These
