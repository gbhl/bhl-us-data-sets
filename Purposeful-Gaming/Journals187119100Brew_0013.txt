inch by inch and feeding like a hen, picking
about on every side with a quick motion of
the head and neck. I timed it repeatedly
and found that it remained under water
30 to 80 seconds, the later period being the
longest noted.
  In the evening I walked to the top of
Ripley's Hill. The shad bush was in full bloom,
and the birches and maples dense with young
foliage. Robins chipping, Sparrows and Song-
sparrows singing among the pines, Red Wings
in the Great Meadows; nothing else noted.
Apparently, the late emigrants have not yet
come.
