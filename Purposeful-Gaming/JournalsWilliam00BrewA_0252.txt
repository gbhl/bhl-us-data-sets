1890
Oct. 2
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Clear and warm with light S.W. wind. At daybreak I
was awakened by the Loons which indulged in a wild
outcry on the Lake. I also heard a Flicker calling.

  Soon after breakfast the camp was visited by two Canada 
Jays and a large mixed flock of Chickadees, Knights and 
Red-bellied Nuthatches with which were several Yellow rumps
and a Black-poll Warbler. A very large Gray cheeked Thrush
also came out of the bushes to look at us and at one
time there were no less than three Kingfishers along the 
shore. The Chickadees were singing continually.

  I visited the camp at Moll's Rock and photographed 
a fine buck which was hanging in front of the tents
and which the party killed with the aid of hounds
three days ago. The cook told me that they had killed
no Ducks or Partridges as yet. They heard a number
of Wilson's Snipe on the Moose Point marsh last night.

  Spent the remainder of the day about camp superintending
my men. There were a great many things to be done and
our work was not finished by nightfall. In fact the
shed camp was not completed. In the evening as we
were sitting around the fire I heard Black Ducks quacking 
in the marshes at the outlet. I also heard in the 
woods the same double whistle that I noted last
year when spending an evening on Moll's Rock. On that
occasion Warren Nouyes asserted that it was made by
a Coupcervin (Lynx canadensis) but I believe it to be
the cry of some species of Owl perhaps Nyctale. It is
low and soft in tone.
