1888
(Nov. 2)
Quail. We flushed a Grouse, however, within 50 yds.
of the spot where we lunched and I shot it.
It was a very red bird (skin preserved). Another,
equally red apparently, was flushed twice in the
same woods. Denton shot at but missed it.
  On our way to the next cover we started
a solitary Snow Bunting from the roadside
& I shot it.

  We next left the horse near the expansion
of the river locally known as the "Duck Roost"
and finished the day by a long hunt up
several birch & alder runs. In one a Grouse rose
above the trees. I dropped it with a broken wing
and a moment later D. seeing it running in
a path shot it again killing it. In another
we found many old and a few perfectly
fresh Woodcock signs and D. finally flushed
the bird, a small [male], on the edge of the cover.
He shot at it but missed when it swung by me
about 50 yds. off and I killed it. My bag
for the day was three grouse & a Woodcock killed
in five shots.

  After leaving this cover we drove to the Hunnewell
place where the gardener told us that Crossbills
are found throughout the year. A flock was
seen by him this morning. He is very sure they
feed on the place (which has many large Norway
spruces).

  Saw numbers of Robins, one Flicker & several
Downy Woodpeckers.
  The fields as still as green as in summer. Most
of the leaves in the woods have fallen.
