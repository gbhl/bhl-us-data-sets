Thursday, February 25, 1869.
Clear & a most lovely day.
Ther. about 18[degrees] - 40[degrees] - 
24[degrees]. Rose at 7A.M.
& went over to the river
hoping to get a shot at
a Gull but I only saw
two or three & returned in
disgust. After breakfast
went down to the Rink
& taking out a velocipede
with Farrar we rode home
on the sidewalk, and
after getting my skates
we rode down again,
but found it very hard work.
Then took the 11A.M.
train for Concord and
when I got there found
Dan in the shop. Skated
a while on the river on
their farm & then went down
through the town calling 
on several girls but none 
of then would go. Took the 
[margin]5.20 train home. In the evening Gardner called & stayed 
till 10,30.[/margin]

  Cloudy all day. Commenced
to snow at about 11A.M.
& by sunset  about four inches
of soft snow had fallen.
Rained most of the
evening. Ther. about, 34[degrees] - 
36[degrees] - 34[degrees].
  Rose as usual
shortly after breakfast
Mr Dexter called to see
my birds. Then plucked
the Cedar birds shot on
the 24th & sent them up
to Morril Wyman who is
just recovering from the 
fever. Then went to work
on my turned stands
& finished them all up
by evening.
  Read most 
of the evening and wrote
several letters.
