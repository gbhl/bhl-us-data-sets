Concord, Massachusetts.
Clear and warm with strong S[outh] wind.
  To Concord with Denton by 9 a.m. train returning by 6.47 train.
At the Manse landing we heard Orioles, a Yellow-billed
Cuckoo, a Dendroica cairulescens (singing in the big white maple),
one of the Nuthatches, a Bobolink on the meadow and several
bull frogs. Starting down river by boat we began to see
Spotted Sandpipers soon after passing Flint's  bridge and
near "the tent", the first Solitary Sandpiper. Between "the
tent" and Ball's Hill we started perhaps fifteen of the
former and five of the latter. At Dakin's Hill the
falling water had exposed an oozy flat of small extent
at the mouth of a brook. On this flat we discovered
five Least Sandpipers. They were very tame and I
killed two at one shot. The others flew off down
river but we found them at the  brook on our way
home where I killed the remaining three.
  Red-wings were fully as numerous as of yore but
we found only one nest (with 5 eggs) although we looked
in several likely places. My impression is that
they have not generally nested yet.
  All over the Great Meadow Bobolinks were rollicking
and singing filling the air with their jingling
melody. Their numbers were fully up to the usual
standard for this locality.
  Orioles were not numerous. We heard perhaps
three in the river maples. Least Flycatchers occurred
as far down as "the tent" but none below that 
point. We heard no Warbling Vireos and what is

  At Len Davis's Hill we left the boat and walked
through the woods to the pines when the Cooper's
