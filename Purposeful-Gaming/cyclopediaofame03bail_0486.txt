present the underlying principles and factors in clear, terse English.

numbered paragraphs in very large type (the size used in "Lessons with 
Plants"); the second part contains informal suggestions to the teacher and

various agricultural subjects, showing the relative importance and position 
of each. It is a skeleton of agricultural science and practice. Full refer- 
ences are made to such literature as the teacher or pupil may be able to 
secure.
