1886
Aug.9
Concord,  Massachusetts.
  Clear and warm with light S.W. wind.
  In the forenoon drove through the Virginia road
and back by way of the Lexington road. Saw nothing

the pines a young D. pinus.
  Late in P.M. sailed down to Hunt's Pond with 
C. just below the new North Bridge a Bittern rose

the Y-tree the broad stretch of river was roaming
with Swallows, chiefly H. Worrerum. Many were
going to event in the button bushes and black willows,
other singing their way to some distant point
up stream. Overheard flocks of Bobolinks and 
Red-wings were scurrying in all directions. At
the [?]nia bed we started about 100 Red-wings.
A little below a Cooper's Hawk cascading past,
a lighting for a moment in a white maple, then 
gliding on. At the same time a Red-tailed was 
sitting in an adjourning tree.
  Just above Hunt's Pond a Wood Duck passed
overheard stirring up stream. The sun had set 
and twilight and gathering past. A Long Sparrow
and Maryland Yellow-throat with the only birds
that we heard singing 'then we heard only
