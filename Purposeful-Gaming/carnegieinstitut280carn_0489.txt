PULSE-RATE. 437 
The pulse cycles of T. M. C. show a shortened duration for the first 
six beats during walking, after which the duration lengthens until the 
fourteenth cycle. The remaining portion of the curve exhibits no 
rapid changes, though a gradual shortening of the duration takes 
place after the twenty-sixth cycle, which is followed by another 
gradual lengthening after the fifty-sixth cycle. At the transition from 
walking to standing the pulse cycles had nearly the same duration as 
at the end of the first transition period, but by the twelfth beat had 
lengthened to 0.71 second and by the twenty-second beat to 0.83 
second. A period of reaction then followed for the next eight beats. 
The curve of E. L. F. shows the rapid shortening of the cycle to 0.61 
second at the eighth beat during walking, followed by four slightly 
lengthened cycles, and a rise to 0.58 second for the twenty-fourth cycle. 
From this point there is a rapid fall in the curve to 0.69 second for the 
thirty-sixth cycle, which value it maintained with fair uniformity 
during the remainder of this transition period. At the transition from 
walking to standing, there appears the usual immediate lengthening 
of the cycle followed by a period of eight beats, during which the cycle 
again shortens. At the thirtieth beat, the cycle had reached its longest 
duration of 0.73 second. From this point until the end of the record 
the cycle continued to shorten so that at the close the duration was 
0.62 second, which was shorter than the average during the walking 
period. 
The curve of H. W. F. is unlike the other curves of this group or of 
Squads A and B in that the pulse cycle undergoes no shortening in 
the transition from standing to walking. It is true that during the 
preliminary 15.2 seconds of standing, the duration had shortened from 
the twentieth to the fourteenth cycles preceding the transition, which 
was coincident with the warning that the walking was about to begin; 
this effect had, however, passed away and a secondary shortening was 
stopped and changed to a lengthened cycle when the walking began. 
Although the records have been searched, no explanation for this 
unusual behavior is apparent. In the case of H. M. S. no signal was 
given and the starting of the treadmill was entirely unexpected by the 
subject. The transition cycle therefore shows no influence of a pre- 
liminary warning. The change in the duration of the pulse cycle during 
walking was from 0.84 to 0.76 second in the first two cycles, and reached 
0.71 second by the sixteenth cycle. The duration lengthened from 
this point to 0.78 second at the twenty-sixth cycle. For the last half 
of this transition record, the cycle lengths are unusually uniform, being 
not far from 0.74 second. The curve for the transition from walking 
to standing differs in no marked respect from the other curves except 
that the thirteenth and fourteenth cycles indicate a sudden shortening 
to an average of 0.66 second, with an immediate return to the previous 
duration.
