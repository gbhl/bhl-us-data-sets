1888
May 17
Clear and warmer. Ther. 47[degrees] at sunrise. Wind S. very light.
  Breakfast at 7 a.m. and started about 7.30. Crossed the
railroad and ascended the hill opposite the station. In
the clearing found a number of birds on the ground
among the stumps - chiefly Sparrows, a few Yellow-rumps
and three Tanagers. In a brush pile I shot a Spizella
monticola.
  Entering the woods we found them pierced by
innumerable logging roads and most of the best timber
already removed. Beech, maple, & hemlock the chief
remaining growth. Birds numerous in small flocks
but unaccountably silent. Occasionally a Zonotrichia
or Winter Wren sang but there were long periods of
total silence despite the clear sky & bright, warm
sunshine. Thus far I have heard very little bird
music in Michigan. There was a Picoides arcticus
in these woods & a Vireo solitarius singing at intervals.
  After an hour or two I returned to the station
while D. pushed further on into the woods. I
found that a heavy flight of Warblers had
arrived in the clearing about the Oden House since
our departure in the early morning. In fact, the
entire open space about the house was alive with
them. Most numerous of all were D. palmarum &
D. coronata. Nearly all were flitting about in
the open alighting on the ground & bushes and
darting upwards after flying insects Dozens were 
often in the air at once. I saw Sialia, Sphyrapicus,
D. coronata, D. palmarum & even a Cuthia thus engaged.
  By dinner time (12 o'clock) I had twenty birds.
Dwight came in an hour later with a slim bag. His
