Vireos Field Sparrows, Maryland Fellow. Acroal[?] began
singing at nearly the same moment. A crow sitting
on the old poplar carried loudly. A higher bull frog
trumphed on the Great Meadow.
  The sun rose at 4.14 after that most of 
the birds went to feeding and then was an 
interval of almost complete believer. The Robins
ceased singing before 4 o'clock. The first Red-eye
was heard at 4.17 three minutes after sunrise.
Shortly after this two Downy Woodpeckers about 300
yds. apart began drowning alternatively evidently
answering one another. A Flicker also drummed 
and sang. A Purple Martin soaring over the hill
warbled. Its rich rolling whistle deserves to a be 
called a long; it expresses hilarity and contentment
  Before sunrise Great Meadow appeared of a 
bluish on glaucous green; the young record-growth
oaks maples and bricks to the south east of a light
vivid green, greener, almost, than grass; the older 
growths of a dull dark green, after sunrise the 
meadows were equally if not more vivid green than
the young woods.
  At 10a.m. started to drive to Cambridge. The wind 
had risen and floated the leaves about drowning
nearly all sound. I heard only to Bobolinks and 
saw a few more. Six Barn Swallows skimming
over grass fields and a brood of fox young first from
the nest on a telegraph vine. Cambridge morning with
English Sparrows. Returned late in P.M. the sun setting before
I reached Lexington. Three Grass Finches singing in one field
in the twilight. Later a Woodcock crossed the road against
the light in the nest skimming just over the trees, a black
tall hunting through spaces like a cannon ball. Not a single

Rhea venenata, black alder, and Conus Serecia.[/margin]
