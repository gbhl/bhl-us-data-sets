BLASTED BUDS_OF UPLAND COTTON 
This condition is not a disease but is due to hereditary malformation of pedicels. The buds 
remain attached to the plant, a condition which is sometimes mistaken for a disease. Instead of 
shedding promptly and leaving a small rounded socket, like that shown in Figure 3, these abnor- 
mal pedicels run down upon the joints of the fruiting branches so that normal shedding does 
not take place. (Fig. 4.)
