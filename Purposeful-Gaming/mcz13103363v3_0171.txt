& went up to Smith's pond where
I shot a ring necked duck. Thence

Wednesday, November 27.
  Clear & a most lovely day
for the season. Ther. about
40 [degrees]���50 [degrees]���32 [degrees].
Rose at 5.30 A.M. &
first went up to Fresh pond
& walked half the way around
it without seeing anything.
Had a most lovely sunrise. Then
met Theo & he went up to Spy
pond with me. We saw a small
duck, probably a buffle head, on the
pond & walked around it after a
boat. Rowed around for nearly
three hours & Theo going ashore
got a shot at him. Got back
at 2 P.M. Finished the
duck stuffed yesterday in P.M. &
took a ride through Belmont with
father. Studied in evening for Monday.
Got a letter from C. Carter.
