1887
May 15
Cambridge, Mass.
  Clear and warm.
  West to Cambridge (from Concord)
yesterday and spent last night and this 
forenoon there. The morning was still and
warm and I was surprised as well as
delighted at the number and vanity of
birds seen and heard about our place.
Orioles, Yellow Warblers, Chipping Sparrows, and
Purple Finches were singing everywhere and 
I actually heard two Geozbeaks (H. Ludeovicianna)
singing at once. There were also Warbling and 
Yellow-throated Vireos, Redstarts, Black-poll
Warblers and a Canada Flycathers, the
latter by Linnett's found. Least Peeves were 
numerous and Song Sparrows were also heard
and hence must be breeding. It was quite
like old times and the cause was evident
win. The English Sparrows are so reduced in
numbers this season that they have failed
to keep out our own birds as has been the
case during the past five years.
  I forgot to include Parula americana in 
the above. I heard two males singing.
  Returned to Concord in the afternoon.
At about 5p.m. while sitting in my 
study I heard Yellow-Cigs (T. [?])
whistling. There seemed to be at least
two or three and they were evidently
flying over the marbles. At about 9 P.M.
I heard least Sandpipers passing overhead.
