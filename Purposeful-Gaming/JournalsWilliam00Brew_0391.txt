1889
Oct. 8
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Cloudy with occasional gleams of sunlight & a few light
showers. Wind W. to S.W. -  moderate. Cold. Snow on all the
higher mountains.
  After spending two rainy days in camp I was
glad to get out again this morning. We went
first to Leonard's Pond which is now practically a
cove of the Lake for the water has risen to
a height never known before in autumn. Among
the stubs were several flocks of Rusty Grachs feeding 
among the drift wood, numerous Robins flocking about 
the black alder berries on which they are now feeding
chiefly, great numbers of Yellow-rumps, several Flickers 
and some Sparrows among which I saw a
young White-crowned. Shot a rusty & missed two 
Flickers. A single Canada Goose scaling on set 
wings the whole length of the Lake honking.

  Passed out of the pond at its eastern end. Saw a
Black Duck feeding in the grass & shot both barrels 
at him vainly - about 50 yds. Next to Whale Back
Cove. About 20 Black Ducks in grass among the stubs
quacking loudly. Paddled up behind a bush & waited. 
They swam within 30 yds., working busily in serious
courses among the drift wood. I could not get two
together & finally they rose & came straight at us
some passing within ten yards or less. I fired both
barrels at high birds. The first flew about 50 yds. &
fell, the other although hard hit kept on. The one
I killed was a fine large bird, evidently a northern.
Landed and while Jim cooked a Duck I walked
more than half way across Whales Back Carry. 
Killed two Grouse. The first Don pointed among
alders. It rose before I saw it and I brought
