the characteristic markings.
  A fifth nest which I discovered on the edge of a 
ditch held only one egg but another lay on the ground 
outside. We also found two empty nests.
  We spent much of the day lying in the grass 
watching the birds and listening to their odd songs 
which are the faintest bird songs I know. I have 
never heard candacutus sing before.
Besides these Sharp-tails of which we must have 
seen and heard at least twenty this marsh contained 
only a few Savanna Sparrows but Barn Swallows were 
skimming over it most of the time and we could hear 
a Meadow Lark in the distance.
  Late in the afternoon we walked to Crescent Beach 
taking, on the way, the larger marsh to the westward. 
Here we found many Savanna Sparrows and five 
or six Sharp-tails besides a few Red-wings and two 
Meadow Larks.
  Took the 6 P.M. train for Boston.
