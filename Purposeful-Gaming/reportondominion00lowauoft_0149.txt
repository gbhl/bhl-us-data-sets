HISTORICAL SUMMARY 77 
voyage. This is memorable as the first instance of a crew win- 
tering in the north and being sufficiently healthy to remain the 
following summer. This year's voyage ended in latitude 65, 
near Whale point in roes Welcome. On the homeward voyage 
Button passed close to a large island south of Southampton, 
which he called Mansell, and not Mansfield, as it is now 
written. 
The following extract from Prince Henry's instructions for 
Button, dated 5th of April, 1612, shows the accurate knowledge 
of Hudson strait possessed at that early date : 8. ' Being in; 
we holde it best for you to keep the northern side, as most free 
from the pester of ice, at least till you be past Cape Henry; 
from thence follow the leading ice, between King James and 
Queen Anne's Foreland, the distance of which two capes observe 
if you can, and what harbour or rode is near them, but yet make 
all the haste you maie to Salisbury island, between which and 
the northerne continent you are like to meet a great hollowe 
billowe from an opening and flowing sea from thence.' 
In the same year, James Hall and William baffin went to the 
west coast of Greenland in search of a gold mine, at Cunning- 
ham fiord near the Arctic circle, which was reported to have 
been worked by the Danes. No ore was found, but traces of old 
workings were discovered. 
Baffin, accompanied by Bylot, sailed through Hudson strait 
in 1615. He then passed north by Mill island and traced the 
northeast shore of Southampton island, from Sea-horse point to 
Cape Comfort, the last being according to his observations in 
latitude 65 n., longitude 85 22' W. Doubling this cape, the 
tide was found to set differently from what had been expected, 
and gave no hope of a passage in that direction, so he turned 
back. The following extract from baffin's journal gives his 
opinion as to the possibility of a passage westward being found 
leading from any of the channels entering Hudson bay : 'And 
now it may be that some expect that I should give my opinion
