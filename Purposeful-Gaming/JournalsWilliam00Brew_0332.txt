rather feeble but abrupt, almost explosive squawk which
we attributed to the same bird. For the first time
it struck me that this mysterious bird may be the
Least Bittern but we have no grounds for anything
more than conjecture, as yet. Whatever the creature is
he was in unusually full song this evening; the peculiar
kik-kik-kik, cree or queee coming incessantly from several
places in this marsh as long as we remained within 
hearing. Besides this cry we heard Marsh Wrens sing
occasionally although it was "pitch" dark. Carolina Rails
were also singing (ka-e) incessantly from 4 P. M. to
11 P. M. We heard five or six in all.
  (We left Wayland for home at 9 A. M. on the 17th.
Torrey & Faxon walked out, before the train started, to
the place where we heard the kicker last night but
all was still there. They describe the meadow as covered
with grass and iris but there are no cat-tails.)
