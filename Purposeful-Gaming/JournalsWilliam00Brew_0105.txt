1888      
Sept 7
Lake Umbagog, Maine
Clear & warm. Wind S. A perfect day.
  Took the steamer at 7.30 a.m. and left her             
off Sturdevant Cove when I embarked in my                    
canoe. The early morning was very foggy                         
but before we reached the Outlet the mists
were dissolved by the sun and the rest of
the day was cloudless with an usually
clear, sparkling atmosphere. There was no
wind until nearly noon and when I started
to paddle in shore to Crocker's camp. I found
the sun very hot and the light from the
calm polished surface of the lake most
dazzling. On the way in I saw there
Phalaropes which I took to be P.hyperborius                  
skimming about, occasionally alighting.

  I spent about two hours at the camp
then with Cocker & the rest of his party,                    Caribou(?)
paddled on to the opposite sand beach to                          Tracks
inspect some tracks which proved to be unlike
any I have ever seen before. They most
resembled Caribou's but the hoofs were unusually
narrow and sharp for that animal. I should
have taken them for the tracks of a cow,
moose were it not for the fact that the
dew claws showed thin impressions at every
step even when the sand was hard. The
hoofs also spread too widely for a Moose's,
of course they must have been made by 
one or the other of these animals as they
certainly were not Deer tracks.  In one
place the animal had taken several [?]
leaps of fifteen feet each. Everywhere the
