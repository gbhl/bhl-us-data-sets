1889
(Oct. 24)
hopping about on the turf, a Blue Jay screaming in the
distance and White-winged Crossbills & Redpolls occasionally 
chattering as they flew high over the woods. Heard a Pine
Grosbeak piping & calling him up shot him. A fine adult [male].

  Next to Rapid River. Just inside the outlet found a flock 
of about 12 Whistlers with one adult male among them and a 
flock of six Hooded Mergansers, three of them adult males, doubtless 
the same birds seen in Leonard's Pond yesterday. Had a
fine chance to stalk them by crossing a narrow neck of land
but just as I felt sure of them I heard one give a warning
kok followed by a rattling k-r-r-r-r. I could see a superb old
drake swimming within easy range but the bushes in the way
were so dense that I dared not risk a shot. A moment later
I saw the flock out in the middle of the river with necks
stretched up and soon after they flew & went out over the
Lake.  Their powers of sight & hearing must be extraordinary.
The drake I saw near me had his crest fully expanded.

  The Whistlers soon flew also. We then rowed up past the
piers starting two more Mergansers & several Sheldrakes but 
getting no shots.

  Started down the Lake just before sunset. As we
were passing Moose Point Jim discovered a Hawk Owl 
perched on the tip of a slender but not tall dead larch
in the flooded forest of larches. We were about to land
when it flew, coming directly towards and alighting
within 100 yds. I walked nearly to within shot having
no cover & making a great crashing as I broke
through the ice among the grass. It flew again but
only a few rods alighting on a rather tall stub. I
walked up to within 30 yds. and firing the choked barrel
of the Fox gun had the satisfaction of seeing it
fall dead. A fine specimen larger than my first
