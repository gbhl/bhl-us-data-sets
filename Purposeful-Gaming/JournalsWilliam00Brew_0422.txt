towards the river driving most of the flock before me.
On reaching the river I found Song Sparrows in numbers
among the thickets and in a belt of sweet gale and
cat-tail flags along the edge of the stream at least ten
or a dozen Swamp Sparrows. The bushy swamps along
the course of the brook as far as the village were
simply alive with Yellow-rumps & Tree Sparrows. These
swamps have a rather vigorous but low growth of
tupelos with an undergrowth of swamp pink (Azalea viscoza)
Andromeda ligustrina, Clethra, Rosa carolina (?) etc. overrun
with such a profusion of wild grape and Smilax varies
as to be practically impenetrable in many [places.
  [delete]Among[/delete] In some of these thickets springs abound, gushing
out of the ground every few rods, spreading about and
[delete]by their warmth[/delete] encouraging a growth of various semi-aquatic
plants which are said to keep green all winter long.
  Among some pines in a hollow near this swamp
I found several Blue Jays one of which I shot.
  Returned to the house at 1.30 P. M. After lunch drove
to the village and out on the Neck, with Capt. Baxter.
Saw no birds of any interest, in fact none whatever
except a few Crows & Chickadees.
