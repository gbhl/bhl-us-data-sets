WHALING 269 
As the crews live during the greater part of the open season 
in the boats, these are fitted with cotton covers supported on 
hoops, and are thus completely roofed in, affording very com- 
fortable if somewhat cramped quarters. Cooking is done with 
oil stoves, and sleeping is arranged for by placing wide boards 
across the intervals between seats. The boats leave the ship 
early in May, long before the ice along the coast begins to break 
up, and they cruise up and down along the edge of the solid 
land-floe looking for whales. During stormy weather, and at 
night, the boats are drawn out on the smooth ice, props are 
placed on each side to keep them upright, and the cover being 
drawn on and snugly secured, afford secure and comfortable 
quarters, provided that the temperature does not drop too low; 
in that case, resort is made to the deerskin sleeping bags for 
greater warmth. 
The west coast of the bay is patrolled in this manner until 
about the middle of June, the cruise extending from Chester- 
field inlet to Whale point, supplies being renewed every week 
or so. Each of the ship's boats is in charge of ,an officer, who 
always attends to the steering. The ' boat-steerers ' are in 
reality the harpooners, and have nothing to do with the steering 
of the boat. 
Towards the end of June the boats cross through the floating 
ice to Southampton island, where they remain until compelled 
to return for fresh supplies, usually about three weeks. A 
second trip to that island is sometimes made, and in August the 
ship, now free from the ice, is taken to repulse bay or the 
Frozen strait connecting it with Fox channel. The ship is 
again left in harbour under the charge of the cook and steward. 
and the boats cruise about until the beginning of September, 
when the ship is taken to winter quarters or sails for home. If 
the intention is to remain all winter, the harbour is reached 
before the middle of the month.
