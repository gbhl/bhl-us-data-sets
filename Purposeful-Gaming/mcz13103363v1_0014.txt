by a harsh
chattering
sound lik
that of a 
Meadow Lark
they seldom
alight on
trees, when
on the ground 
they do not
hop like warblers
and other birds
that live on
trees, but run
like Sandpipers
they seldom
come except
in the very
wildest of weather
and I have
heard, sometimes
no oftener than
once in ten
years but
this is rather
doubtful; they
breed in Spitzbergen.
