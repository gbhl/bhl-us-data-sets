a good deal. Ther. about, 26[degrees] - 38[degrees] -
26[degrees]. Took a walk in A.M.
rising at 6. As soon as I got out
of the house I saw a rusty blackbird
on the top of our chestnut tree.
Saw three blue birds and heard
a meadow lark. Coming home
from school met Dan riding
down with his mother and sister.
They called about two hours
afterwards. After they had
gone went up to 'the pond'
and saw a gull but did not
fire at anything. In the 
evening got out my Latin at
home. Father put down part of
the floorcloth in my room.
N. Brewster went to day.

A.M. and went shooting but did
not get a shot at any thing.
Heard some quails plainly. Saw
two blue birds and heard many
song sparrows. Heard some young tree
sparrows learing how to sing. Got home
at 8.25 A.M. In A.M. R. Deane and I
went shooting into Waltham being carried
up by Bill. Saw three ruffed grouse
and almost fired at one. Followed Dans
tracks and found him. We all eat lunch
together in a sunny spot. I shot a male 
blue bird. We then went to Dan's house got
the old cat and shot her. I shot a musk rat.
Dan. carried us down to Waverly. Saw two red
wings for the first time back of 'the brickyard'
& chased them. In the evening stuffed the
bluebird. Saw six or seven purple finches.
