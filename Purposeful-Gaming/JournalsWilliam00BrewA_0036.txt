Banana Creek, Florida.
backs were exposed. I shot at one but failed to
kill it. Every few hundred yards we passed
Prairie Warblers singing in the mangroves. They 
were the only small birds noted except a few
Maryland Yellow throats. To my surprise Quarterman
knew the Warblers and asserts that they breed here!
  Landing on a narrow neck between the creek and 
an area of the bay I found the latter filled
with Ducks. I was peeping through the bushes at 
them when suddenly all arose at once. A bunch 
of Green-winged Teal came over me and I killed
one with my second barrel missing with the first.
The next instant a Duck Hawk glided over me
within twenty yards. He it was, probably, who 
alarmed the Duck.
  At the point where the creek entered the bay we
made a stand & put out the decoys Quarterman
then going off to rouse up the Ducks. Hundreds
flew past me but only three came within range.
I killed two of them both Ring-necks. A superb
Ardea [?] also came and alighted just outside
the decoys where I shot it sitting. I was amazed
at its enormous size. Several Brown Pelicans came
past my stand within twenty yards or less & one
alighted on the water near me.
  When Quarterman returned I changed my
stand to a point opposite & sent him off again.
Ducks came rapidly to this stand and decoyed well.
I killed thirteen in a short time, [delete]four[/delete] Blue winged Teal
four Shovelers, the remaining eight Scaups with a
few Ring-necks. Had one shot at a Widgeon*[Wigeon] which
[?]. Rowing home at sunset shot another Teal but 
it fell in mangroves & was lost.
