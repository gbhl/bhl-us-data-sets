June 30
Ashby, Massachusetts.
  Clear and hot with but little breeze. Left the
house at about nine o'clock and drove dir-
rectly to the large pond in Ashburnham. On the
way, and probably within the limits of Ashby
we stopped for a half hour or more at an
extensive woods of fine large white and pitch
pine intermixed with a good many spruces. Here
we heard two Solitary Vireos, a Red-bellied Nut-
hatch and a Blackburnian Warbler and several
Hermit Thrushes besides common birds.
A number of small birds attracted our
attention to [delete]the[/delete] a deep glen where they were
making a great scolding and chirping. Upon
entering this glen we heard a succession of
loud notes which resemble those of the Flicker,
but were hoarser and more shrilly given. There
we clearly recognised as the cry of the Sharp
Shinned Hawk. We thought we got a glimpse
of the bird flying off through the trees, but
were not certain.
  Continuing our drive we reached the pond
where we put up at a small barn by the road
side and took our lunch under an apple tree
near the shore on the pond. It was intensely hot
and [delete]very[/delete] few birds were singing. Early
in the afternoon we started again and
drove to the swamp at the western base
of Watatic where we spent about two hours,
from four to six o'clock, rambling about and
listening to the birds. A Snow Bird which was
singing [delete]stationed[/delete] on the top of [delete]the[/delete] a large
