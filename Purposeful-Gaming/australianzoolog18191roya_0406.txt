Frontal plate divided into three; an equal anterior pair followed by a single 
plate. Parietal scutes absent, the top of the head covered with numerous subequal 
scales. Nasal partially divided; nostril directed upwards and outward; fissure 
extending from nostril to anterior loreal scutes. Loreal scutes, including small 
granules, 30 on right and 26 on left side. Preoculars 4 right, 3 left; postoculars 
6 right, 5 left. Supraocular entire on right side (with partial division), divided 
on left with anterior portion the largest. 
Mental groove relatively long, bordered anteriorly by first infralabials; two 
scales lie in rear of groove. Lateral border of groove of 9 and 10 scales similar 
in size to other gulars. 
Dorsal scales smooth without apical pits; the first row large but less than 
half as broad as ventrals. At one head length behind head scales in 53 rows; at 
midbody, 70 rows; one head length anterior to the cloaca, 35 rows. About 
50% of dorsal scale rows doubled (see discussion). 
Ventrals 429. Subcaudals 155, mostly divided (7, 18, 19, 34, 35, 36, 37, 
118, 119 are entire). Anal single. Cloacal spurs present. 
One pair of premaxillary teeth. Maxillary teeth; 11 on right maxilla (estimated 
6 missing), 14 on left (est. - 3); estimated maxillary total 17. Palatine teeth; 
10 on right (est. - 5), 15 on left (intact series). Dentary teeth; 15 on right 
(est. - 3), 14 on left (est. - 4); estimated dentary total 18. 
Hemipenis forked extending for about 10 subcaudals forked about 3 
subcaudals proximal to this. Chevron like flounces of organ, 7. 
DESCRIPTION OF PARATYPE 
As for holotype with the following exceptions (figures in brackets refer to 
holotype ) . 
Supralabials 17 (15); 8, 9 meet eye (7, 8) on left; 8, 9, 10 meet eye 
(7, 8, 9) on right. Infralabials 24 right, 22 left (24); seven on left pitted. 
Posterior prefrontal area 25 (22). Loreals 45 (30) right, 43 (26) left. Postoculars 
5 (6) right, 7 (5) left. Supraoculars right divided, left entire (opposite 
arrangement in holotype). Ventrals 445 (429). Subcaudals 163 (155), mostly 
divided; 15 single subcaudals (9). 
COLOUR NOTES 
Pale fawn above merging into a lighter putty grey on the lower sides. A series 
of dark grey-brown blotches on the dorsal surface is irregularly arranged in four 
to five longitudinal rows. These dark blotches and streaks are largest in the 
vertebral series and much smaller laterally. Many of the dorsal scales carry an 
indistinct dark brown or black spot at the apex. The dorsal pattern becomes more 
obscure posteriorly. The dorsal scales of the tail are dark-edged producing a 
reticulated effect. The top of the head is pale fawn intermixed to a lesser degree with 
dark brown. Several of the head shields have the centre or the edge coloured dark
