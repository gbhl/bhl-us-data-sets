1888
Oct. 23
Revere Beach, Massachusetts.
Cloudy and warm wind S. W. threatening rain (which came heavily
during the following night and day).
  To Revere Beach with Mr. J. Dwight Jr. by 9 A. M. train.
Left the cars at Point of Pines and spent the first two
hours in the hotel grounds, which were swarming with
birds a heavy flight having evidently settled there the
previous night. There were about 200 D. coronata, a number
of Turdus pallasii, many sparrows, chiefly Juncos & White
throat with a few Field & Swamp Sparrows, some Kinglets
(R. satrapa) and a single Dendroica p. hypochrysa. I shot
the latter, a [female] Junco, and a fine adult [male] Swamp Sparrow.
  We next crossed the railroad and began to beat the
sale marshes. Dwight started a Passerculus princeps
which flew past me. I missed a long cross shot at it
but soon afterwards flushed it again & killed it.
  The tide was nearly at full flood and we began searching
for Sharp-tailed Finches in the beds of long salt grass that
fringed the river and its tributary creeks. In nearly every
bed of any extent we flushed one or two of these birds
and in the course of the next two hours killed twelve
- all that we saw. We shot them all flying. They
invariably rose wild at first but after the first rise lay
rather closely. They looked very blue and small & flew
with a slightly undulating motion. Dwight got seven
of the twelve. He also shot a Cistothorus palustris.
There were a few Titlarks flying about over the marshes.
  Chadbourne joined us at noon. After lunch I
shot another P. princeps which the train started from
the railroad embankment and which settled in the
marsh when I flushed & killed it.
  At the "Narrow Gauge Hotel" we hired an old and very
