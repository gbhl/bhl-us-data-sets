Crow.  Blackbird
 Saw large flocks of them 
all day they generally 
flew in a northerly 
direction and appeared 
to be migrating.

  Saw one, it was probably 
a Wood Pewee or Phebe
Bird, shot by D. F. on the 22nd.
This at 63 above zero.
  Snipe
[margin]March 20, 1865[/margin]
  Saw one I had just shot a
Red Wing, when the snipe
flew by me it was very large
but it flew so quickly that
I could not tell what kind 
it was.
  Cat bird ?

  Saw it quite plainly back
of the brickyard. (I think
I must have been mistaken as I have
not seen one since and to day is April 22.
