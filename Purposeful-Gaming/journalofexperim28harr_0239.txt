the old and new parts. Consequently a pair of incomplete 
mesenteries of the first grade and its accompanying orange 
stripes are sometimes lacking in a region Where they ordinarily 
occur (p. 195). Certain other irregularities in the occurrence of 
incomplete mesenteries are found (p. 196). 
The orange stripes seen prominently on the living specimens 
normally occupy the complete endocoels and the incomplete 
endocoels of the first order (p. 207). Since spaces of these 
grades almost invariably alternate regularly, the orange stripes 
are commonly present in even numbers in individuals that have 
not divided or have completely regenerated following a division 
(pp. 114, 122). 
When a fission plane passes through an orange stripe, that 
stripe disappears (p. 209). As regeneration proceeds orange 
stripes are formed in their characteristic positions, including the 
bounding endocoels, provided these are not incomplete endocoels 
of the second or lower grade (p. 209). 
Probably orange stripes arise, in the new area, first in the 
complete endocoels and only later in the incomplete endocoels 
of the highest grade (p. 215). The number of orange stripes is 
strictly limited by the. number of mesenteries of the first two 
cycles, no new stripes being formed either in the old tissue or in 
the new tissue after the characteristic spaces are occupied 
(p. 216). 
Odd numbers of orange stripes are usually to be explained on 
the basis of incomplete regeneration, occasionally on the ground 
of irregularity in the cycle of mesenteries of the highest incom- 
plete grade Certain cases of unusual conditions of orange 
stripes remain unexplained (pp. 195, 210, 213, 221, 222). 
The number, position, breadth, and color of the orange stripes 
of any individual give significant indications of its internal con- 
dition (pp. 215 to 217), but mere enumerations of orange stripes 
are of little value. The numbers of stripes in individuals of 
groups examined by the writer varies from zero to twenty-two, 
the plotted curve showing modes at seven and twelve with a 
tendency toward minor modes at even numbers above twelve 
stripes and at odd numbers below ten. This is interpreted as
