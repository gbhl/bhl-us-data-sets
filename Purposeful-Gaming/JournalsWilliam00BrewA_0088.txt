than I getting ten birds, eight Scoters and
two Old Squaws. He had at least three shots
to my one, however. 
  There was a fairly large flight of Scoters
about 1000 passing between 5 and 9 a.m.
Of them probably 700 were Velvet Scoters, two
hundred Black Scoters and the balance Surf
Scoters. A good many straggling birds came
from the E. [East] but by far the greater number
& all the large flocks came from the West. 
We could see them several miles away. They
flew usually in a long line at right angles to
[?this] [?] & at a height of from three or
four to forty yards. As a [?rule] they passed our
decoys without apparently noticing them. But
occasionally one or two would leave a flock &
[?scale] down. 
  Old Squaws & Sheldrake flew in considerable
numbers. We also saw several Gannets, Cormorants,
Horned Grebes, and Red-throated Loons, a good
many Herring Gulls & Commons Loons, one Murre, 
one Black Guillemot, and a pair of King Eiders. 
The latter came within [?long] shot of M. who 
wounded the drake, a young bird, badly. 
At about 9.30 the wind rose and we came
in to breakfast. During the remainder of
the day the sea was too rough for us
to get out.
  We saw Song Sparrows and Flickers on
the island but no other land birds.
The island reminds me strongly of Star Island
at the Isles of Shoals.
