March 26
Suwanee River, Florida.
Clear in the morning, afternoon cloudy. Wind S.W.
  We cast loose the scow early this morning and
drifted down into the East Pass where we tied
to the bank before breakfast. The scenery changed
considerably after we passed the mouth of Gopher
River the cypresses becoming lower and more
scattering the country more swampy with wide
belts of tall grass along the water's edge. Narrow
creeks debouched from the main river at frequent
intervals. On every side a boundless wilderness
without clearings, boats or other signs of 
man's presence.
  The birds changed somewhat also. We began
to see more Red-wings and to hear more
Yellow-throated Warblers. The Swallow tailed 
Kites disappeared while Anhingas and
Wood Ducks became more scarce.
  After breakfast we all started out in 
our canoes. Chapman went down the Pass
to the Gulf finding extensive marshes which
were apparently barren of bird life.
I took a creek which entered on the 
East side and followed it about two 
miles. Saw nothing of interest except
five Wood Ducks, two males and three
females. They were paddling idly about in
mid stream and I watched them for several 
minutes through the glass at about 80 yds.
In swimming they ocillated their heads
and necks forward and back at each
stroke of their feet.
  There were a few Prothonotaries along this
