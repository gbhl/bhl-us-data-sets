1886
Aug. 2
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and cool with strong W. wind.
  In the forenoon drove Purdie to Walden to
the site of Thoreau's house. The woods were full of
birds, Wood Pewees, Pine Warblers etc. in a large
mixed flock.  The chattering pipe of Crossbills also
heard, apparently a good many of them, flying.
I heard them everywhere now.
  From Walden crossed through Lincoln to
Lees Bridge and back to town by Nice Acre Corner
bridge. At Lee's Bridge heard a Marsh Mere (C. Stellaris)
swinging in the meadows. Also heard a Tanager 
and an Indigo both in full song.
  Late in the afternoon drove through Sleepy Hollow
Cemetery and heard a Night hawk there. Warblers
migrating in some numbers in the evening.

  Out for only an hour in the afternoon
when I sailed down to Great Meadow. Swallows
rather numerous along the river.
  Clear and cool with strong NW wind.
  Sailed up river as far as the Friends farm this
forenoon meeting D. with Mr. Hoar and Mr. Moon,
by appointment at Mr. Ho's Landing.

  A good many Swallows along the river but 
only one Martin away them, The only birds
heard singing was a Meadow Lark, a Yellow Warbler
or Two, and a Wood Pecker.
  Shot a Yellow Warbler and a Water Thrush
near my boat house. The Water Thrush was a young
bird with rusty-tipped secondaries. Unfortunately, I spoiled it.
