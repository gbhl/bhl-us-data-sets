at 11 A.M. When we first entered
the wood started a rabbit but lost him.
Then lunch, then Don started a Rf grouse,
then down to Bittern swamp when
Don brought out a stick & a tree sparrow
that I shot; then over Well. hill through
the woods. Saw a shrike & a muskrat
besides a golden crest & heard blue
jays. Studied at R's in evening.

Sunday, December 29.
  Clear and a beautiful day
but rather windy. Ther.
about 30 [degrees]���36 [degrees]���24 [degrees].
Rose rather late so I did
not feed the dog but hurried
down to Sabbath school
where I was late. Attended
church but Mr. McK. did
not preach. When I got
back from church gave
Don some bread. Read
most of P.M. and took a
walk up to Mt. Auburn
with father. Read most
of evening and fed Dan
as usual. The ground is
now entirely bare of snow
excepting the remains of drifts
under fences.
