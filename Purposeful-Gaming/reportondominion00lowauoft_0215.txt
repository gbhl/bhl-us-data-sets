From the above table, it will be seen that the total Eskimo 
population of the eastern half of Arctic America ranges between 
3,400 and 3,700 individuals. These people are scattered along 
the coasts of the mainland and northern islands, while a few 
live continuously inland to the west of Hudson bay. The pre- 
sent northern limit of permanent settlement of the Eskimos, in 
eastern Canada, is Lancaster sound and its western extensions, 
in about 74 n. latitude. Many traces of their habitations have 
been found on the islands north of Lancaster sound, and far 
north along the west side of Ellesmere island, but these only 
represent the temporary quarters of stragglers from the south, 
who return after a short soj urn in the north. 
On the west side of Hudson bay the natives extend southward 
to the neighbourhood of Churchill, the most southern tribe being 
the Padlimiut. who inhabit the country northward from 
Churchill to Ranken inlet, and inland in a northwest direction 
along the edge of the forest-line to about the latitude of Ranken 
inlet. Their northern neighbours are the Kenipitumiut, who 
occupy the territory about Chesterfield inlet and along the rivers 
tributary to that great bay. The Kenipitumiut are not very 
numerous, and, according to Captain George Comer, who has 
made a very careful census of the natives of the west part of 
Hudson bay, they only number 140 persons. The Aivillingmiut 
are next northward, and are more confined to the coast than the 
southern natives; they consequently depend largely on the sea 
animals for food and clothing, the southern people living mostly
