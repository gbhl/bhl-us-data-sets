(Sept 1)
sang at intervals near the house. On the lake
large pickerel were jumping incessantly. We
could hear them plash in the water half 
a mile or more away. I noticed many Ephemera
floating dead or dying on the surface.

Sept. 2
Clear & cool with high N.W. wind.
  In p.m. sailed over to the Lake House paddling
most of the way back at sunset. Saw a pair 
of Black Ducks in Ryerson's pond. Ring-neck Plover
whistling but not seen. A Heron (A. herodias)
flapping slowly athwart the sunset sky. Water
very high & most of the meadows flooded.
At the Lake House learned that Mr. Betton
killed seven Woodcock in Morse run
yesterday.

Sept 3
Clear and warm. Wind S.W.
  Not feeling well I spent most of the day
in the house. Late in the afternoon beat
the Woodcock covers within walking distance to
the eastward. No birds or even old signs. A
few Warblers and Titmice scattered about
through the woods but no mixed flocks
seen. The brakes are still perfectly green & very
rank this year, in places as tall as my
head.
