An old field grown up to weeds and
broom sedge was fairly alive with Sparrows.
Most of them were C. passerinus but I saw
fully a dozen Pencaea aestivalis. One was so
tame that I thought it wounded and
nearly caught it in my hand. Heard
a Pine Warbler and a Flicker singing. Nothing
else in song yet, not even cardinals.
  Most of the country covered to-day
was often pine woods with but little ground
palmetto. We found four bevies of Quail in
the space of eight or ten acres. They are
tame when they have not been hunted,
and often fly only thirty or forty yards
before alighting again.
  I shot a fine adult Ardea caerulea from
the wagon. It was sitting on the top of a
tall dead pine by the roadside near a
pool of water.
  We passed many small lakes in two
of which numerous Greebes (P. podiceps) were
scattered about.
