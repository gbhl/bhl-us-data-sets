1889
Nov. 25
Waltham & Belmont, Mass.
Cloudy and warm but damp with light S. W. wind.
  Of at 9.30 A. M. driving to the Warren place, taking George with
me to hold the horse. I also took the Gordon setter puppy "Dandy",
this being his first experience in the woods. I looked for Grouse
and Quail in several likely places but saw none. The puppy
behaved very well and hunted with some vigor & intelligence.
  The chief object of my trip, however, was to look for Crossbills,
Pine Grosbeaks & Redpolls all of which have been reported as
about in some numbers.
  O the hill behind the Warren place I heard a flock of Red
Crossbills distinctly, twice, but failed to find them. In the
dense young pitch pines on this hill were several Chickadees and
Kinglets (satrapa) accompanied by a Certhia which I shot. In
the red cedars in the pasture on the north slope were a
number of Blue Jays. Crows cawing overhead at intervals,
all straggling birds. Goldfinches heard flying. This note is
more suggestion of summer than that of any other of out
winter residents.
  Meeting George at the lane we started on towards the Flagg place.
Just beyond the willows came on a flock of about 50 Redpolls
& killed five, all linariae. Three English Sparrows in the road here
I shot at them killing one and breaking the wing of another which
took to a stone wall like a native & escaped. Also shot a
Certhia in a willow over the road.
  Next to the Belmont willows. Beat rock meadow for Snipe
but got only a wet foot for my pains getting one one of my
rubber boots in a hole. The meadow absolutely deserted but 
at its eastern end in the delta a flock of fully 40 Tree
Sparrows. I drove then on ahead up into Prospect St.
Several of them sang as loudly and freely as in Spring.
  Next and last I tried the cedar woods on the crest  of
the hill. Two Flickers and a few Chickadees & Kinglets were
