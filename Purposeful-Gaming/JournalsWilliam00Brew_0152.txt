marsh. Shortly afterwards four Black
Ducks accompanied by two Teal came
in and alighted. Then a single Black
Duck came in. Then a pair of Widgeon
Lumen paddled me to the latter and
they rose within ten yards. I missed
the first and killed the second.
Light rather dim. Finally a large
flock of Black Ducks came in a single
bird swinging past within long
range and dropped him into the
Lake with a broken wing but he
got into the grass and escaped.
