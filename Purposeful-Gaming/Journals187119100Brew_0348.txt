1887
Sept. 4
MAINE, (L. Umbagog.)
Clear with fresh N.W. wind
  Took the steamer at about 9 a.m. and went up the 
Lake to Moll's Rock where I launched my canoe and
paddled over to the Outlet. No Ducks in sight and no
waders save a solitary little Ereunetes. The water is still
very high and little mud visable about the outlet.

  Setting sail I can out into the Lake before a strong,
steady breeze. Not over half-a-mile from the Outlet I
came upon three Northern Phalaropes bobbing about on
the rough water nearly in the middle of the Lake. I
shot one with each barrel, both on the water. The third
flew off down wind. Following I soon began to see
others single or in twos or threes, and once a flock
of five. They were very restless and some of them
unmistakably shy rising a hundred yards or more 
ahead skimming close over the surface and alighting
again. Often one would flutter upwards to a height
of fifteen or twenty feet and pose for a moment at 
the same time shaking its wings and tail violently.
Their usual flight was precisely like that of a Sandpiper
the only note I heard a shot [?] very like that of
the Sandling. On the water they acted precisely like 
those [?] in the Gulf in 1881. They were evidently
feeding as they swam. I got another sitting shot at
two birds, again killing one with each barrel.

  This experience closed the day's adventure. I ran
all the rest of the way home under sail without
firing a shot. At times the breeze nearly died away, 
at others it was fresh and steady. I heard Ducks
flapping the water with their wings & quacking in
several of the coves. Saw a single Gull, perhaps a 
Tern, in the distance.
