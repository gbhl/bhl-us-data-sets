1886
Aug.6
Concord, Massachusetts.
 Clear, still and cool with a bracing quality in
the air like September.
  In the forenoon down to Carlisle by way of 
the Estabrook road returning past the Parker lot.

The woods were cool and attraction with few
deer fliers to trouble the horse although these insects
literally swarmed on Aug. 2nd the date of my 
last drive. There were hardly any birds singing,
two or three Red-eyes, a Field Sparrow, a Tanager
and two Indigo Birds with a single Towhee being
all that we heard. Jays in flocks and already
at the autumnal antics, screaming, chattering,
whining, and trooping from tree to tree. One party
must have comprised at least twenty birds. In 
the midst of this clamorous company were two
Red-shouldered Hawks screaming loudly and 
incessantly. I supposed at first that the Jays
were making the sound until the Hawks flew.
A high Solitary Vireo was heard in full song in 
the woods.

  In weed-grown fields and old orchards I saw 
surreal large mixed flocks of Robins, Blue birds
and Sparrows (S. socialis chiefly) with a strong Kingbird
or Phoebe usually adding to the variety.
Clethra in full bloom and very fragrance and
pleasing; golden rod and asters first beginning.
  Late in the afternoon I paddled down
river to Hunt's Pond landing and walking well
out into Great Meadow to watch the movements
of birds at sunset, returning in the twilight.
 On the way down I heard three Yellow Warblers
