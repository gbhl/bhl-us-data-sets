1890
May 29
Belmont, Massachusetts.
Forenoon in the Prospect St. Region.
A fair day with much cloudiness and [?] N.E. wind.
  Starting at 8.30 A.M. I drove to Prospect St. George left me at
the cedar woods where the road forks and returning at 12.30 met me at
the pine near the glen.
  My route was through the cedar woods, past the Owl orchard, over
the barberry pastures on the hill [delete]just[/delete] S.W. of Arlington heights, down into
the head of the birch runs, thence down these runs, across the scrub oak
pine to the pine on Prospect St., across Prospect St. through the 
deep glen to the Concord turnpike.
  I spent most of the morning searching the barberry pastures for
Prairie Warblers' nests and with such success that I found four
in all, 4,4,5 and 4 eggs respectively, all fresh or nearly so. My first nest
was in a hollow in the hilly pasture N.W. of the Owl orchard, my
next at the foot of the slope beyond, my third near the pine on
Prospect St. and not ten yards from where I found two nests (a
first & second laying) on June 4 & 13th 1878, my fourth nearly over to the
turnpike where Dwight took a nest last year. The barberry bushes
were in full bloom to-day marking, as on so many previous
occasions, the exact time for full sets of fresh eggs of D. discolor.

nests[/margin]
  Throughout the country which I traversed during my walk
Chestnut-sided Warblers were much less numerous than in former years
and I heard no White-eyed Vireos. With the exception of these
two species all the characteristic birds of this region where*[were] fully
up to their normal numbers and several species more numerous 
than I have ever found them here before. By actual count
I heard singing seven Nashville Warblers and five Brown Thrashers.
Both of these birds as well as several others were particularly
numerous in the hollow at the head of the birch runs. 
  I heard only a single H. chrysoptera in the run near the
pine on Prospect St. In the Glen I found a [female] Hummingbird
which acted as if nesting buzzing about low over my head
