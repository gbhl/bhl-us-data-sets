Reached Mim's at about 3 P.M. It is simply a 
station in the flat pine woods with a small 
hotel, a store & one or two cabins, as quiet not

little hotel proved clean and comfortable, however.
  Getting out my 20 gauge I started for a

with us and he found a small bevy of Quail

  There were many small birds about Mim's.
A flock of a dozen or more Florida Gracks and
as many Red-wings near the station, a larger
flock (probably 100) Chipping Sparrows, and 
the usual number of Mocking Birds & 
Shrikes. Heard [one?] Sitta carolinensis.

by the way. The dogs found four bevies of
Quail in the first few miles but both
dogs and birds worked badly and we
