1886
Sept. 7
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and very warm with light S.W. wind.
To Estabrook woods at 10 A.M. Beginning 
at the further end I went over very usual route
and returned to the Manse by dinner time (1.30)
I found a small mixed flock in the oak woods
and another in the pines, both very much
changed since my last visit. The first flock
contained, besides the usual number of Chickadees,
about 5 D. Striata, 2 D. Varius, 1 Hel. ruficapilla and
one V. olivaceus. The flock in the pine woods was 
larger comprising about 10 D. Striata, 2 D. Varius,
one D. Pennsylvanica, 1 Hel. ruficapilla.
  Besides these flocks I saw or heard many
D. Striata, either scattered about highly or two or
three together.  They have perhaps reached nearly
the height of their abundance.

  The most interesting experience was finding
a brood of young Cedar Birds just from the 
nest, their parents feeding them with huckleberries.
They were in oak woods and kept in the tops
of the trees where they sat erect and still keeping 
in nearly the same time as the old birds.
  Chipmunks were abundant and noisy to-day
for the fist time this autumn.
  Late in the afternoon I paddled down
river t the Lisania bed where I pushed my
boat into the reeds and sat an hour or more 
watching the sunset and waiting for a 
possible shot at Ducks.  Two Wood Ducks went
over high but no other appeared. A few 
adult female Marsh Hawk, however, came scaling
