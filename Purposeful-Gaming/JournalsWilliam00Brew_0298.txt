1889
(May 17)
Hawks have bred for several seasons past. The first
nest that Denton climbed to proved to be theirs but
it was empty although evidently new and beautifully
line with the white inner bark of one of the dead
poplars numerous in these woods. There were no signs
that this nest had been robbed but I fear that
something has happened either to it or the birds. We
did not see either of the latter but I think I heard
one of them.
  High among the tall pines in these woods several
Blackburnianus were singing. I shot a fine [male], in the very
pitch pine where I killed one in June 1886.
  There were also several D. virens, many Creepers (Minotilla)
a Parula, a pair of Vireo solitarius and two wood
Pewees. A Chickadee was at work excavating a hole for
its nest in a poplar stump. I also saw a fine Tanager
and heard one Grosbeak. Of course Oven-birds were not
wanting.
  The heat made us so thirsty that we crossed the meadow
to the brook which proved very warm. Following it up we
finally came to its source a cold spring of delicious
water at the head of the meadow. Near this spring
in some sparsely growing alders we started a [female] Woodcock
and from young the latter nearly full grown.
  The woods were in nearly full leaf to-day and
the meadows looked as in early June, the [?]
flags two feet or more tall. lady's slippers in full
bloom and barberry bushes in nearly full bloom.
Bird's foot violets and Houstonias a little past
but still very showy and attractive.
