THE RURAL SCIENCE SERIES 
The Fertility of the Land 
A Summary Sketch of the Relationship of 
farm-practice to the Maintaining and Increasing of the Productivity of the Soil 
By I. P. ROBERTS 
Director of the College of Agriculture, Cornell University 
FIFTH edition-421 pages-45 illustrations-$1.25 
his work, written by one who has been termed "the wisest farmer in 
America," takes up the treatment of the soil from the standpoint of the 
farmer rather than that of the scientist. It embodies the results of years 
of careful experimentation and observation along practical lines, and will be 
found helpful and inspiring to a marked degree. no other one book could be 
so heartily recommended to the progressive farmer as this interesting series 
of talks-for Professor roberts seems to be personally addressing the reader. 
THE FERTILITY OF THE LAND includes A Chat with the Young Farmer; Inventory 
of the Land; Evolution of the Plow (fully illustrated); The Means and Philosophy of 
Tilling the Land (telling how and why we should plow, harrow, etc.); Conserving 
Moisture; Irrigation and Drainage; Manures (in four unique, illustrated chapters); 
Nitrogen; Potash and Phosphoric Acid; Lime and other dressings; Commercial Fertil- 
izers; The Use of Clovers, Fallows and Rotations; Appendix. 
"In short, the book will be found helpful to the farmer, in that it will enable him 
to go through the routine of his everyday work with intelligence, and. therefore- with 
skill and the assurance of wider success."-garden and Forest 
The Spraying of Plants 
a Succinct Account of the History, Principles and Practice of the 
Application of Liquids and Powders to Plants for the Purpose of Destroying Insects and Fungi 
By E. G. LODEMAN 
Late Instructor in Horticulture in the Cornell University 
399 pages-92 illustrations-$1.00 
n these days this subject is conceded to be of enormous importance to the 
horticulturist; for it is only by intelligent spraying that many large fruit 
interests are saved from utter extinction. Professor Lodeman treats the 
subject both historically and practically, and the work forms the only complete 
manual of spraying, being admittedly the standard authority. Not only is 
spraying discussed in its relations to the plant or tree and the crop, but the 
diseases and insects which are to be combated are most fully presented. 
THE SPRAYING of PLANTS includes in its first part a complete history of the rise of 
spraying, both in this country and abroad. There are also full illustrated accounts of 
pumps and nozzles, complete recipes of formulas, and the like. The second part, compris- 
ing 135 pages, entitled "Specific Directions for Spraying Cultivated Plants," is an alpha- 
betical illustrated account of the various insects and fungi, with methods of treating them. 
"Mr. lodeman has gathered the results on an immense amount of experiments, both 
in Europe and America, and his book can be trusted not only as a manual of practice, 
but as a true and well-classified record of our knowledge on this subject at the present 
time."-garden and Forest.
