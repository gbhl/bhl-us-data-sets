160 CRUISE of THE neptune 
Whalers, to renew their supplies of ammunition and tobacco, or 
go to the northward to hunt the musk-ox in the Spring. 
The Aivilliks of that coast confine themselves chiefly to the 
seaboard. Their name signifies walrus hunters, and they go 
inland in the autumn only to procure sufficient deerskins for 
their winter clothing. 
The Nechilliks and Igluliks, living farther north, do not 
often come in contact with the Whalers, and depend largely on 
their southern neighbours for ammunition and other articles of 
civilization. They are in a much more primitive state, without 
any modifications in their ancient customs and beliefs. The 
greater number are without guns, and kill their game with the 
bow and arrow or with the spear. 
The other natives on the shores of Fox channel rarely come 
in contact with the whites, and are in a similar primitive state. 
These include the Padliks and Sikosiliks, and in the same 
category were the natives of Southampton island, now all dead. 
The Eskimos living about frobisher bay and Cumberland 
gulf congregate about the whaling stations, and remain there 
for the greater part of the year. The whaling season in these 
places is in the fall, spring and early summer, so the natives 
have only the latter part of the summer in which to hunt deer 
for their winter clothing. The animals are found abundantly 
about the great lakes nettilling and Amadjuak, which are 
located far inland to the westward. 
The natives of Big island and the north shore of Hudson 
strait are, as before mentioned, employed on the Scotch whaling 
steamer, or at the stations at repulse bay and at Lake Harbour, 
where a mica mine is worked; consequently they do not follow 
their old customs. 
A whaling station was established in 1903, at Ponds inlet, 
and the Eskimos of the northeastern part of Baffin island will
