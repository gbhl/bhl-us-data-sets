Tuesday, April 20, 1869.
  Cloudy & rained several
times.  Ther. about 50[degrees] - 
65[degrees] - 50[degrees]. Rose a little
early & studied. Rode
down to school as my heel
was blistered. Got out a
little after the close of
school & on the way home
had my hair cut. They
are now boarding in the
lower story of the old house.
After dinner I studied about
an hour. Then went 
over to the pond and
sailed most of the p.m.
in my boat, and set
out willows on my
shooting point. Coming
back the wind blew almost
a gale.
  Tringa Bartramia heard one
first after dark. Spizella
Monticola, heard one but they
are almost all gone.
Wednesday, April 21, 1869.
Clear but very windy.
Ther. about 50[degrees] - 65[degrees] - 
50[degrees]. Rose as usual.
Rode down to school in
A.M. as my heel is
blistered and troubles
me much. Corrected the
paper written yesterday
& got out at the close
of school. After getting
home learnt my Greek.
After dinner had Tiger
harnessed and went first
to my Crow's nest. Got four
eggs & fired at the bird as she
left. Then into Waltham, found
a Downie's with a bird in the
hole; also a Crow's which I did
not go up to.  Then shot a male 
Accipiter [?], flying, &
wounded his mate. Coming
home heard three Snipe humming
over the meadows.
