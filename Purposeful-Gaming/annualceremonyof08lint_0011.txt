Annual Ceremony of the Pawnee 
Medicine Men 
A general description of the Pawnee, with an ac- 
count of their religious beliefs and social organization, 
has been given in Leaflet No. 5 of this series. Although 
geographically a Plains tribe, they differed in several 
respects from the typical tribes of the region. While 
the latter were all nomadic hunters, the Pawnee were 
settled agriculturists, inhabiting permanent towns and 
subsisting largely on their crops. When on hunting 
trips, they used the typical skin-covered tent of the 
plains, but in their towns they built large houses Of 
wood covered with earth. A model of one of these 
houses is shown in the miniature group illustrating 
the annual ceremony of the Medicine Men. 
■ The earth lodges of the Pawnee were dome-shaped, 
about forty feet in diameter and fifteen feet high. The 
roof was supported by two concentric rows of uprights, 
g the outer row being planted just in front of a ledge, 
je23 about a foot and a half high, which entirely surrounded 
the inside of the lodge. The outer posts, which varied 
in number according to the size of the lodge, were 
about seven feet high, and were placed about the same 
distance apart. The inner row of posts stood about 
half way between the outer wall of the lodge and its 
center, and were about twelve feet high. They varied 
in number from four to ten. All the uprights were 
^ forked and bore a row of cross beams, which supported 
rafters extending from the outer uprights to a point
