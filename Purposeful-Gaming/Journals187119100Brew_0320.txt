1887           
June 26    
Winchendon, Worcestor Co., Mass.
Clear and cool (almost frosty in the early morning with     
high N.[North] wind.
  Breakfasting at 7 a.m. Purdie and I started at about 8
and drove out to Bailey's reaching there at 9 a.m. and
finding Bailey awaiting us and with him a young man
by the name of Mr Perry (not Mr S, Perry of Worcester) who had
come out from town for a day in the woods.
  We started almost immediately walking down the road a
few hundred yards then striking in on the left (West) side and
entering a large open bog sprinkled with young evergreens
and other low trees or bushes among which I noticed a few
poison dogwoods and several Abies alba. Shortly after
entering this place the dog flushed a large brood of young Grouse
two of which fluttered past us, one alighting in a bush.
  A little further on we heard the familiar Jill-pill-pill of a
Contopus borialis and soon espied a pair of these fine Flycatchers
on the tops of some tall spruces that bordered the western edge
of the bog. Entering this wooded edge we searched awhile vainly
for the nest, then decided to watch the birds. Purdie, meanwhile,
poking about inside the woods flushed a Canada Flycatcher
and after a long search found its nest with four egge prettily
placed in the side of a mound covered with sphagmum.
While we were standing about it I saw one of the Flycatchers
dart off through the trees and alight with a quivering motion
of the wings directly in its nest which was high up in
a black spruce on the edge of the woods. Bailey climbed 
to it for me and found a set of three eggs slightly incubated.
The birds called anxiously as he climbed the tree but did not
dart at him as they usually do. Another pair of the same
species attracted by their clamor came about but we
were unable to follow them when they left again.
A pair of Blackburnian Warblers were also roused by the
