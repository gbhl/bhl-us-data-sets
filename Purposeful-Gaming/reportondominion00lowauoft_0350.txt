238 CRUISE OF THE neptune 
' The rock at the point south of Corbett inlet is a massive 
green, fine or medium-grained diabase, which is now almost 
entirely altered into a mass of chlorite, epidote, zoisite and cal- 
cite. - This diabase is cut by many small veins of quartz 
and calcite, which contain large quantities of pyrite, arseno- 
pyrite and chalcopyrite.' 
' From Term point westward the shore is rocky, and the steep 
rocky cliffs descend into rather deep water. The rock is a dark- 
green diabase almost entirely altered to sausserite, and is cut 
by many veins of quartz and calcite, holding copper-pyrites.' 
' On the northern shore of Mistake bay, nine miles west of 
Term point, is a long point of similar diabase. Seven miles 
further southwest, about the middle of the west shore of Mis- 
take bay, is a high point of similar dark-green diabase, contain- 
ing in many places a large amount of copper-pyrites, and cut by 
small veins of quartz studded with iron pyrites.' 
' Two miles south of Sir Biddy island is a prominent rocky 
point, with a high rocky island lying a short distance off it. 
From this prominent point the shore turns westward, and is 
bold and rocky, being composed of dark-green fine-grained dia- 
base, studded with copper-pyrites.' 
The above extracts from Tyrrell's report show that on his 
hurried journey southward from Chesterfield inlet he found 
Huronian rocks occupying the shores of the bay for a distance 
of nearly a hundred miles. At haphazard landings along this 
shore traces of copper deposits were found in a number of 
places, and these would point to important discoveries as likely 
to follow systematic search on this area. 
A considerable amount of magnetic pyrites was found in the 
squeezed diabase rocks along the east coast of Hudson bay, but 
careful analyses failed to show any contained gold, nickel or 
copper in a number of specimens from various localities on that
