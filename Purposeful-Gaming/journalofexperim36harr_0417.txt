PROMPT PUBLICATION 
The Author can greatly assist the Publishers of this Journal 
in attaining prompt publication of his paper by following these 
four suggestions : 
1. Abstract Send with the manuscript an Abstract containing 
not more than 250 words, in the precise form of The Bibliographic 
Service Card, so that the paper when accepted can be scheduled 
for a definite issue as soon as received by the Publisher from the 
Editor. 
2. Manuscript. Send the Manuscript to the Editor prepared 
as described in the Notice to Contributors, to conform to the style 
of the Journal (see third page of cover). 
3. Illustrations. Send the Illustrations in complete and fin- 
ished form for engraving, drawings and photographs being pro- 
tected from bending or breaking when shipped by mail or express. 
4. Proofs. Send the Publisher early notice of any change in 
your address, to obviate delay. Carefully correct and mail 
proofs to the Editor as soon as possible after their arrival. 
By assuming and meeting these responsibilities, the author 
avoids loss of time, correspondence that may be required to get 
the Abstract, Manuscript and Illustrations in proper form, and 
does all in his power to obtain prompt publication.
