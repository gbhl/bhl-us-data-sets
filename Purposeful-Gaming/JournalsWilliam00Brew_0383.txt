Sept. 26
Cloudy with frequent heavy showers. A dark, dismal day.
  C.F.B. & E.R.S. came up on the steamer this morning on their
way home via Errol & Colebrook. I joined them off the camp
and went with them to Errol. As the steamer passed Moll's
Carry I saw a fine ad [female] Duck Hawk sitting on the top of a
stub. It flew at fully 200 yards and skimmed off over the
Lake.

  At Errol Jim was waiting for me with my boat & Don. After
putting the ladies in the stage we started back. In Mile Meadow
a flock of twelve Wood Ducks alighted in the grass. Jim paddled
me within good range and I shot two on the water & a
third as it rose. One took to shore where Don found it.

  Next to the head of Curtis Meadow. About 75 Black Ducks
there but the water was so high that we could get no
cover in which to approach them. Where the brook comes
in at the extreme head of this meadow we started three
Wood Ducks. They came back over us and I made a
clean double, killing both birds dead. A moment later
another bird came down giving me an equally good
shot which I missed. Reached camp in a pouring rain
at about 2 p.m.

  Spelman & Chadbourne went up the Migalloway &
spent the entire day there. In Bear Brook Chadbourne
killed two fine adult male Wood Ducks at one shot. There
were four of them with about a dozen females and
young birds. Of the latter he got one. Will Sargent shot
a fox in Pulpit Rock pond when it trotted out of the
grass within a few yards of them.
