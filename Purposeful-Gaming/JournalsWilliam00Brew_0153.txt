1888
Oct. 4.
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Clear with a gale of wind from the N. W.
Spent the day about camp as it was
impossible to do any shooting on ac-
count of the wind. late in P. M. this
moderated and we started out. On the
marshes near the Outlet saw nothing but a
white old marsh Hawk. Leonard's Pond also
proved blank. Just inside Moose Point we
saw our first Duck a Green-winged Teal
It was swimming in a pool in the grass
and rose fully, 80 yards away spring-
ing straight up about 20 ft. and
flying very swiftly. I fired both bar-
rels at it in vain. Shortly after a sin-
gle Black Duck rose from the middle
of the marsh. We then took stands for
the evening shooting. Lumen having
my spare gun on this occasion. First
came four Black Ducks from Rapid
River. They passed me nearly 100 yds/
off and I fired only one barrel, which
had no effect. Next a flock of about
a dozen Black Ducks skimmed past
me within 30 yds. but directly behind
me. I twisted about as well as I could
but only managed to fire one barrel
and that at the tail bird of the flock
He was hard hit and towered passing
over Lumen who killed him. Finally
when it was nearly dark a single
Black Duck quacking loudly came over
me flying very fast before the wind. At
