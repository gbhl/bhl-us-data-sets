Returning to the stand found that C. had had only
three long  shots, all misses. I joined him and presently
a Ring-neck Duck scaled in over the decoys giving him
a fair shot which he missed with both barrels. Soon after
another came & I killed it. A few minutes later
another which C. killed. After this several long shots,
by both, at birds hurtling past down wind; all misses.
Then a pair of Ring-necks alighted & C. killed them both.
He afterwards got another single bird and bagged one
of a pair of Florida Black Ducks which alighted in
a cove just above the stand. 
  After this we passed over two hours without getting
a single good shot at Ducks but C. killed one
from a bunch of four Stilt Sandpipers and also shot
at and badly wounded a Duck Hawk which, however,
escaped.
  Royal Terns were flying about all day and we
saw several Ring-billed Gulls and a few Cormorants.
Two or three Ardea wardi also passed the stand,
one fine one coming nearly within range.
  Late in the afternoon we returned to the vessel.  
  The country over which I walked to-day is
peculiar & very unlike that about Enterprise. The
island is everywhere intersected with creeks and has
innumerable small shallow ponds surrounded by tall
sedge with occasional patches of Cat tails. Along these
creeks mangroves form a well nigh impenetrable
belt. I saw many shrubs that were new to me &
that I  could not name, one of them in bloom,
the flowers scattering and pale lilac in color.
  The Duck Hawk that C. shot at was started by
our man Anderson. It was eating a Duck on the shore.
