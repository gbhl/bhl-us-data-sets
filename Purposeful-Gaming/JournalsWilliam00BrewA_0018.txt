of the wind which is lashing their tops about
violently. Going down to the wharf to see the old
steamer Fox on which I made the Wekiva trip in
1877 and which although no longer seaworthy
still holds together and is used as a house boat
by a cracker family, I found several Tit-larks
running about on the beach.
  After dinner got a saddle horse and rode
for a hour or two. First took the old road
to Mellonville which I found nearly as in 1877
the only changes being that several of the houses
and small stores have disappeared or become
ruins. The hotel still stands but is sadly out
of repair and seemed to be uninhabited. On the 
way over I saw four Loggerhead Shrikes and two
Blue Jays, in the street directly in front of the
hotel a pair of Ground Doves and a Sparrow
which I took to be C. passerinus. To revive old
memories still further I next followed the road
back into the pine woods where in 1877 I took
the nest of Sitta pusilla & shot my first [Pelicanas?].
Those places looked more or less familiar but
the woods have been somewhat changed by firs etc.
Saw a House Wren & heard Yellow-rumps but 
no Woodpeckers or Nuthatches.
  Returning to the "city" of Sanford where I saw
two [?] Progne subis circling about a box & 
three or four Passerculus savanna sitting on the
ridgepole of a cabin I next rode out a mile
or more to the southward. Heard Bluebirds in 
the air (the sad fall note as at the N.) and in
some scrub saw two Warblers which I think were
H. celata. Back to town about sunset.
