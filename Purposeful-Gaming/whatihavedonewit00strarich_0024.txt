"The bubbling brook doth leap when I come by, 
Because my feet find measure with its call; 
The birds know when the friend they love is nigh, 
For I am known to them, both great and small. 
The flower that on the lonely hillside grows 
Expects me there when spring its bloom has given; 
And many a tree and bush my wanderings knows, 
And e'en the clouds and silent stars of heaven." 
Very.
