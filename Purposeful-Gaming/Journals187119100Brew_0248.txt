(Oct. I9)
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
  Returning found Alva back with another Grouse and a musk
rat. In my absence a flock on fine Black Ducks had alighted in
the river just above the forks, but the crackling of our fire
had quickly started them again. Blue Jays flying back and forth
over the meadows Fox, mink and musk-rat, and Duck tracks on
the mud. No deer tracks.

  Started for homse just before sun-set, Melvin leading our
boat by twenty minutes. He shot a Great Blue Heron and saw
five musk-rats. We saw literally nothing but a few Juncos. It
was dark when we reached the landing.
Oct. 20
  Clear, still and warm. I spent the day in the house work-
ing on birds. Melivin went to the Foy place and walked into C.
Pond. He saw eight Grouse, about twelve Canada Jays and one
Pileated Woodpecker.
Oct. 2I 
  Cloudy and warm with high wind.  A blank day. Drove up to
Morse's run after dinner and beat for Woodccok, but failed to
find any. Saw five Robbins.  Returned and walked out on the Ty-
ler road beyond the bog. Woods silent and deserted. Saw only
a few Blue Jays.
Oct. 22
  Clear and warm. A highly gusty west wind. Went down river
and out to Birch point in the forenoon. No Ducks in the Lake.
Returning saw a Solitary, a Titlark and a Wilson's Snipe near
together on a mud-flat. Shot all three. Lunched near Peaslee's
Brook. Then went up Cambride river about half way to the 
forks. Three Grouse together on the bank. Shot all three sit-
ting, one flying up to a bush, the third running at my first
shot. Further up shot a female Picoides arcticus and a female
Hylotomus. Returning shot a fourth Grouse sitting in the top
of a leafless alder feeding on berries of Vibremen opulus. All
four Grouse young females.  Saw several Sitta canadensis, Spiz-
ella moticola and Juncos along the banks. Killed with a paddle
a tiny shrew that came skipping down the bank and tried to swim
across the river looking like a withered leaf. A large water
beetle rising high in the air in the twilight and flying off
over the woods.

Oct. 23
  Clear and cool with strong north-west wind.
  Off at nine o'clock in the forenoon with Baker, Gerrish and 
Alva, driving down to Thale Brown's where we left our horses and 
struck into extensive larch swamp on the east side of the 
Cambridge. In this swamp we spent the day, searching especi-
ally for Spruce Grouse. Alva found and shot a fine Cock which
