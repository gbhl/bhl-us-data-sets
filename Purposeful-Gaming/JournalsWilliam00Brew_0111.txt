1888 
Sept. 11.
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
  Clear, still very hot. Rose at daylight and took
a plunge in the river. Fished till 7 but caught
nothing. Then started for C. Pond. At dam shot
one of a pair of young A. herodius that came
flying over. Three bends up, came on a 7 Sheldrake,
nearly full grown but pinionless. Shot both
barrels and missed. Farther on came up with
them again. Shot one at 60 yards. The others
scuttled around the bend and disappeared.
A mile above I took to the meadow S. dragging
the boat. 'Don" came to point in long grass. 5
Spruce Grouse rose all together with a grand
rush and roar of wings. I killed with 1st
missed with 2nd barrel. Another bird rose and
I dropped it. One bird wing broken. Got on log
and chuckled. In green woods (spruce and fir)
I shot three more one on log over point, two in
trees. One of latter uttered a warbling whistle.
All young well grown. One mangled by wad.
Back to camp by noon. On way "Don" started five of
the young Sheldrake from grass and I shot two.
We also started a Black Duck which I dropped.
One fresh track of bear and one of doe on sand bars.
No Sandpipers either yesterday or today. Heard
Solitary Sand. at daybreak, also a Whippoorwill.
Jim Bernier went to Forks by land and killed
ad. [male] Spruce Grouse knocking off his head.
Crossbill (Red) Pine Linnets and 1 Picoides arcticus.
Whippoorwill sang at evening.
