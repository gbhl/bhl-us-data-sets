April 23
Cambridge, Mass.
Warm with S. to S.W. wind  ther. rising to 68[degrees]. The

one began humming. He soon came over us and 
we made him out at over, about 100 yds. up
flying in a huge circle every now and then

& giving a prolonged humming. After this
Bolles saw him a third time but none of
