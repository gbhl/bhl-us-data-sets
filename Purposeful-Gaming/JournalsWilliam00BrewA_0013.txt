Feb. 25
Clear and very warm. Ther. 72 [degrees] at 2 P.M.
  Left Boston at 6 P.M. last evening with C.
and reached Washington at noon today, going
to the Arlington for the night. The was [sleighing?]
in Boston yesterday but the parks in Washington
are nearly as forward as in April. Forsythia,
Pyrus japonica, Spirea van-houtei*[houttei] and various
other shrubs in full bloom, Magnolia buds opening 
grass everywhere intense green, some men mowing
with scythes in the Smithsonian grounds. Henshaw
says Fox Sparrows are abundant & Chimney Swifts
have been reported on fairly good authority. I 
saw a large flock of Crow-blackbirds near
Baltimore. Song Sparrows singing freely in 
Washington.

Feb.26
Clear and warm with S. wind.
  Drove about Washington in the forenoon with C.
Started south by the 4.15 P.M. train. The late
afternoon clear and still, the Potomac perfectly
calm. Saw a few Ducks, probably Blue-bills
in the main river and a flock of what I 
took for Buffle-heads in one of its connecting
bays. At Quantico where the train stopped
for a few minutes I heard Blue-birds &
Red wings singing. Saw many of the latter 
in the marshes scattered about singly and
also in a very large flock whirling over a
field near the edge of the river. Crows
everywhere in great numbers. No Buzzards.
The fields not much greener than in
Mass. Hyla pickeringii piping at sunset
