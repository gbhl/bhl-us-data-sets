1886
June 28
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Cloudy morning; clear afternoon, a cool day;
wind N.E. but a mere breath.
  To the ice pond woods in search of the 
Solitary Vireos nest. I soon heard one of the birds
whirring and one going to the spot found him
hopping about in a pine, low down. As I was
watching him his mate flew directly to the nest
which was in a birch at least fifteen feet above
the ground and not in the least concealed.
The pain were building, or rather lining a nest.
Both birds entered in alternately and tinkered it
a little but neither worked at all steadily. Evidently
they were merely putting on the finishing touches.
  Leaving them I spent the remainder of the 
morning exploring an extensive wood of dense
but not heavy Oak and pine timber. Saw
nothing of much interest except a large broad
of young Grouse at least half grown and as
mild and Hawks. The mother was with them but
although she whined and checked a little she 
kept at a safe distance.
  Pyrrhula in bloom everywhere. The Azalia
past its prime.
