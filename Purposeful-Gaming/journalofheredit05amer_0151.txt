FLOWERS OF THE GAILEY TREE. 
This Japanese Persimmon tree has been under observation since 1909, and each year has 
produced a very large percentage of staminate (male) flowers of the type shown at 
the right, wide open. The normal, pistillate (female) flowers are seen at the left, wide 
open. All trees propagated from this parent have likewise borne staminate flowers, 
and it may therefore be considered the most reliable pollen producer which has yet 
been developed in the United States. (Figure 17.)
