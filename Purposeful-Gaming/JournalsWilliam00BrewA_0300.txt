1890
Oct. 30
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Cloudy with frequent snow-squalls and strong
N.W. wind. A bleak, raw day, the mountains 
white with snow nearly to thin bases.
[margin]Return to 
Bethel & to
Cambridge, Mass.[/margin]
  Started for Bethel at 10 A.M. but got no further
than Upton hill when my driver, Mr. King, became
anxious about his other wagon which, drawn
by a pair of horses, was to have started 
immediately after us. We waited for it awhile
and then King went back on foot. As he
did not return I drove our horses into Abbott's
barn and spent two hours or more walking about
the place. Saw two very large flocks of Juncos,
- at least fifty in one flock - whirling restlessly
from place to place. 
  King finally returned with the missing wagon 
which had been overturned, fortunately without
injury to any of its occupants. It was now
past one o'clock so we dined at Abbott's &
after more delays finally started again at
three o'clock reaching Bethel at about eight.
Saw several flocks of Juncos on the way 
but nothing else. 
  On the 31st I went through to Cambridge
by cars.
