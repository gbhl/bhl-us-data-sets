1888
Sept. 22.
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Cloudy with drizzling rain all day.
Wind veering from W. to E. and S.E. Lake
nearly calm at times, air misty and
mountains obscured. Off at 8 a.m.
steering for North Arm where we saw
a flock of Sea Coots alight early in the 
morning. Found them just above
Moose Pt. Very wild rising at 100 yards,
apparently all were young (gray) Coots
probably Butter-bills. The flock disap-
peared down the Lake. About 50 Shel- 
drake in Whale-back Cove. Tried to
drive them but failed. Returned to
Moose Pt and meeting Dr. Hill and Mr.
Skillings beat the marsh with them.
No Snipe. Rana palustris all over the
marsh "snoring" as in early spring. It 
was raining at the time. Leaving the
Point I shot a Sheldrake that tried to
pass on right. Next to Glaspy Cove. Nothing
there. After awhile six small Gulls app-
eared out in the Lake. We paddled out
and I shot a young Sterna hirundo 
and an adult Larus phila. The other
four were all Terns probably S. hirundo.
Also saw two Phalaropes (P. hyperboreus, I 
think). In p.m. cruised in my canoe for
Terns and Phalaropes. Saw the four for-
mer and one of the latter but got no shots.
At the Outlet heard a Yellow-leg and Grass
Bird at evening. Bubo hooting after dark. 
About 10 p.m. there was a loud catawaul-
