May 7
Waltham-Belmont, Mass.
over on the Payson place, one in the meadow 
east of the Warren place, the other two on
Rock meadow.
  Met Faxon in the Warren runs. He showed
me the spot where he heard a Woodcock
sing in April at intervals between the 2nd and 
26th. After the latter date he visited the
place several evenings but heard nothing.
There were two birds singing one evening. We
searched all the runs for Woodcock but could 
find neither the birds nor their signs. I
am inclined to think that the individuals
he observed were migrants.
  Vegetation has advanced but little since 
the 2nd. The shad bush is now in full bloom
and the birches, barberry bushes and poplars
are green with young leaves but the woods
as a rule show little foliage. Columbines,
violets, anemonies, saxifraga and an early
Ranunculus in flower. Vanessa antiopa is 
the only butterfly at all numerous as yet.
