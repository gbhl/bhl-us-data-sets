March 23
Suwanee River, Florida.
Clear and cool with a moderate N. wind. Scarcely
a cloud in the sky all day, the sun warm at
noon.
  Du Bose left us this morning in a huff and
started for home on foot. Immediately after
breakfast Chapman got the scow under way
and ran her before the wind all the forenoon
making about eight miles. 
  I paddled this distance in my canoe shooting 
by the way. I landed first directly oppose
our last night's camping place in the swamp 
where we shot yesterday afternoon. Found a 
large flock of Warblers and killed two Bachman's 
very quickly and soon after a celato. Heard a
Warbler song new to me most like Parula's but
less guttural and all on the same key (not
rising at the end like Parula's). Discovered the
bird in the top of a sweet [green?] no other 
bird seen. Saw him sing, then shot him 
and found that I had a [male] H. bachmanni.
Heard another but could not find him.
Paddled down stream a mile or more and 
seeing Dr. Allen on shore landed again.
Found a beautiful spot a bluff with a 
hard sand beach, behind open dry oak 
woods with sunny openings & wood paths.
These woods were literally alive with birds
chiefly Warblers, with several Vireos of these
species (olivaceus, solitaries and one flavifrons)
Red-bellied and Pileated Woodpeckers, Cardinals, 
etc. Gray Squirrels were very numerous and
tame uttering their choking barks on every
