paddled towards them. Another Pigeon
Hawk seen here. Thence to Moose Point
A flock of at least 50 Black Ducks feed-
ing on the flooded meadow. Jim let
the canoe drift before the find and
we got within about 100 yds. before they
put up their necks. I shot into a
solid mass of them with #4 and
wing-tipped one which we got easily.
It was as long a shot as I ever saw
made with a loose charge. Took the
same stand as last night. About 20
Black Ducks came in but I got only
three shots, all long ones and all misses
I did not miss a fair shot all day
but has a surprising run of chan-
ces at 70-80 yds. and all but the flock
shot misses. The flight of small birds
these last two days has been simply
amazing. Saw at least 500 Yellow-rumps
today. Among the Black Ducks at
Sweats Meadow were four Widgeon.
