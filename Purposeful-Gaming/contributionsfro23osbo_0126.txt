cells in thickness, while the other was wider, only one cell in 
thickness, and with a broad notched apex. Series of short 
tracheids were formed in both the thickened region of the elonga- 
ted portion of the sporophyte and on its branch. Another out- 
growth, prothallus-like in form, developed from the margin 
of one wing of the prothallium and bore on its margin an antheri- 
dium. 
FIGS. 12-20 
FIG. 15 shows an apogamous outgrowth which developed by 
the narrowing and lengthening of the apex of a prothallium one 
cell in thickness. It soon branched, one branch being very 
irregular in form and only one cell in thickness, while the other 
was elongated and several cells in thickness in the central 
region where it bore a group of long tracheids. A small side 
branch was given off from the apogamous outgrowth.
