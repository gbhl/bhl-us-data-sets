yards of the boat. The first one was only wing
broken & took to the bank but "Don" tracked her
a few rods and pulled her out from under a
log.
  Only a short distance further on we started a 
[female] Wood Duck from a mass of drift wood. She
rose out of range and flew only a short distance
only to repeat the maneuver when we again came
in sight of her.

  Pausing only a few minutes to examine an
old moose track (the animal had waded down
the bed of the river for several hundred yards)
we returned down the meadows and reached the
forks a little before sunset. For the remainder of
the way I sat with gun in hand ready for
a shot and finally was rewarded by discovering
a Grouse sitting erect and still in an alder
at the very spot where I shot one last year.
I killed her sitting and this ended the day's
sport.

  Just behind West's I saw this morning (and also
on the morning of the 20th) a small flock of
Loxia americana among which were two L. Leucoptera.
They were crowded together on a piece of base ground
where they were apparently picking at the sandy
soil.
