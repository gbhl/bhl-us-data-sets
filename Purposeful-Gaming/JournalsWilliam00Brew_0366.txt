1889
(Sept. 5)
Hawk beating down the alder run below finally passing out
over the Lake. Crossbills piping at frequent intervals, flying
over the woods in their usual restless manner. Purple Finches
and Goldfinches also heard. A Hylotomus calling in the distance.
Two Grouse drumming occasionally in different directions.
I searched for one in vain going well back into the
hard woods and scanning each suitable log closely. On my
return down the hillside Don found what may have
been the other drummer, making a staunch point on
him among some pasture spruces. The bird rose wild
and went off unseen.
  It was intensely hot in this position but delightfully
cool in the shade of the woods. I heard several young
Warblers singing in listless, broken tones. I also heard
a Broad-winged Hawk and a bird which I took to be
a Canada Jay making an odd medley of chuckling
and whistling sounds.
  The woods show touches of gold and crimson in 
many places but there are no considerable areas of
bright color as yet. The water in the Lake is at about
medium height, the banks of the Cambridge Pine
showing but no mud flats uncovered. I hear
Pickering's Hylas constantly in the woods. No birds in 
full song except Vireo solitarius Young Song Sparrows
warbling a little in the early mornings.

  Steve Morse tells me that a flock of fully 500 Coots 
was seen on Richardson Lake on the morning of the
2nd. He has also seen many Black Ducks. Grouse
are said to be unusually numerous.
