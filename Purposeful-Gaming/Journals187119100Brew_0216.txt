1886
Sept.21
Concord, Massachusetts.
A clear frosty morning followed by a sunny day with
high N.W. wind. Ther. 46[degrees] at sunrise, 63[degrees] at noon (Transcript rep.)
  Spent the morning in Estabrook woods going over about 
my usual ground. In spite of the boisterous wind I 
saw an unusual number of birds, especially D. striata
which were literally everywhere singing, in small pastures,
and in large flocks both with and without other species.

  In the oak woods I found a rather larger mixed flock
unchiding (besides D. striata) five D. varius (2 ad [male]), 1 Parula,
one D. Carrulescens, a pair of Sitta canadensis, several
Ziturica and an ad. [male] Pyransa rubra in full autumn
plumage.
  In the  heavy white pine woods three was another
flock containing (besides D. striata) seven D. virius
one Sayornis and several Ziturica.
  I saw two small Thrushes and shot one which
proved to a T. swainsonii.
  Besides the above there were many Jays and
Robins, a few Flickers, an Accipiter fuscus which
glided past me through a birch thicket, and a fine 
Buteo borealis drifting overheard before the strong
wind.
  The birches were swarming with Aphidae both with 
and without wings, the winged ones filling the 
air in the openings, both stages (?) covering every
leaf and twig as well as the ground beneath and
annoying me by crawling over my neck and face.
The Warblers were feasting on this abundant prey.
  At sunset a chipping Sparrow burst with
full song in the orchard behind the house.
