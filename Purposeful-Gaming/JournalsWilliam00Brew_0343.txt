1889
(June 26)
Ashby, Massachusetts
though a dense forest composed almost entirely
of black spruces some of which attained a
height of fifty- or sixty feet and a diameter
of a foot or more. [delete]Black and Blue[/delete] Blackburnian Warblers and
Black Throated Green Warblers were numerous
in these woods and lower down, on the edge
of the deep ravine, we heard a Golden Crested
Kinglet singing. Upon following up the song
we finally found both him and his mate.
They were accompanied by a single young
bird only a few days from the nest, which they
were feeding. Near this spot in an opening I
shot a male Snow Bird. As we were returning to
the house where we left the horse, late in the
afternoon, we heard a Henslow's Sparrow sing-
ing in a little bit of meadow in a pasture
on the mountain side, and, going to the spot,
flushed the bird several times. It chirpped
[delete]at us[/delete] vigorously and evidently had young some
where in the neighborhood. The drive home
was very delightful, although we were treated 
to one or two more showers on the way. In
the evening after dark we heard another Hens-
low's Sparrow singing in the meadow near
our house.
