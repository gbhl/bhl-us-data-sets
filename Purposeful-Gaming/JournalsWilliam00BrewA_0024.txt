suddenly stopped and pointed. Getting out we
went to him and flushed a fine large bevy of
Quail. They flew into some low palmetto scrub on the
edge of a marsh when we had a number of shots.
Less than 20 yds beyond the red dog found a
second bevy which lay very closely. The other two
setters backed Tom handsomely the three standing
nearly in line &[and] presenting a beautiful picture.
Within the next mile two more bevies, one a
very large one. were found. We both shot rather
poorly but bagged 26 birds and shot down four
more which the dogs failed to find. I made
two doubles with the 20 gauge gun and killed 15
of the total bag.
During the drive we saw three Sparrow Hawks.
They were all exceedingly shy. The commonest
birds throughout the pine woods were Palm and
Pine Warblers, Bluebirds, Flickers and Brussards.
Saw only two or three Sitta pusilla.
  Reached Mim's about dark and packing our
trunks took the 67 p.m. train for Fitus with
a ride of only five miles.
