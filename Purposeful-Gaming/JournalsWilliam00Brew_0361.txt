  Clear with little wind; warm at noon
but rather frosty early in the morning. To
the maple swamp at 8 o'clock a.m., spend-
ing about two hours there. Found much of the
swamp under water from the recent rains.
The foliage of the maples in many places
was turned quite as much as it ordinarily
is late in September. Water Thrushes were
very numerous throughout the swamp, in
fact, more so than I remember to have ever
seen them there before. One, evidently an
old male, sang there two or three times
quite as freely and vigorously as in
spring. There were a number of Rose
Breasted Grosbeaks, most of them in
full autumnal plumage, in the maples
near the entrance to the swamp. I shot one of them. Cat
Birds were numerous everywhere. The only
birds singing besides the Water Thrush were
two Red-eyed Vireos which I heard at fre-
quent intervals during my stay. Saw a
single Humming Bird, a Green Heron, three
Wilson's Thrushes, a Black and White Creep-
er, and several Robins. Searched careful-
ly for Connecticut Warblers, but without
success. The report of my pistol fired
at the Grosbeak started a number of
Night Herons which were roosting in the
trees about the pond. I did not see any of
them, but they made a great outcry for
several seconds. Saw a Green Heron and heard a Blue
Jay scream. Swamp Sparrows were not nearly so numer-
ous as usual.
