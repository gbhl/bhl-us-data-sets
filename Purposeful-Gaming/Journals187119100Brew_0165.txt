1886
(Aug.10)
whistling in the distance an hour or more after
dark and equally late on Spotted Sandpiper
which I called down from the upper air. It
alighted near the boat its wings rustling audibly
as it passed us.
  A few Warblers migrating and our Thrush, I
think T. fuscus. Autumnal (tree) crickets in 
full cry everywhere for the first time. Green frogs
still rather noisy; no bull frogs at all this 
evening.
