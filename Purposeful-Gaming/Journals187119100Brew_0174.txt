1886
Aug.16
Concord, Massachusetts.
  The annexed clipping from this
evenings "Transcript" gives an
accurate summary of the weather 
for the past 48 hours.
  Made an early start this morning getting off
in my canoe at 7 a.m. I had intended to 
paddle down to the big woods below Ball's Hill
without stopping by the way but as usual I 
was tempted by the sight of birds that I 
wanted, along the banks, and nearly two houses
over consumed in making the trip. I got only
three shots on the way, however, killing two adult
male D. aestiva and missing a few ad. Oriole.
Heard three or four. Water Thrushes a pair of 
Upland Ploves circling high over the meadows;
several Song Sparrows and Maryland Yellow-Throats,
besides a Field Sparrow, singing; and saw
a Bittern, three Red tailed Hawks, one Marsh
Hawk and one Red-shouldered [?].

  At Ball's Hill saw two Turtle Doves flying together
at the reed below there were abotu 20 Barn Swallows
and from a fair Bank Swallows a lightening on the 
willows and skimming about over the river.
  Thus far the morning had been cloudy and 
still; but the sun came out and a brisk S. wind
started just before I landed opposite the big woods.
  On ascending the hill I found the great mixed
flock within 100 yards of where I left it often
