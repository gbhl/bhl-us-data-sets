narrow channel between the islands a flock of about
15 Old Squaws rose ahead and becoming "rattled" dashed
past us several times doubling & twisting like [?].
I shot down two males but got only an indif-
ferent bird in changing plumage. The one which escaped
was in full summer dress, apparently. M. also shot down
one which got away.
  We spent the forenoon sitting on the sunny side of
the High Rock. I took my gun in hopes of getting a
shot at a Horned Grebe but after a while fell asleep. At
length Mackay awaked me by reaching over me for the 
20 gauge with which he instantly shot a Grebe that
was swimming beneath us. It drifted out but I got 
a boat and following secured it. I then sculled about 
among the islands seeing many Old Squaws, some in fine
summer plumage.
  Early in the afternoon we started out again and
took stations off the High Rock, Mackay lying  outside.
Beyond him were two other boats. There was a 
moderate flight of fowl during the afternoon
but they did not give us much shooting, the greater
number passing outside. I shot down three with one
barrel of the 20 gauge securing two of them, a fine pair 
of Surf Scoters, the third bird escaping by diving.
Just before this Mackay fired both barrels at a pair 
of Ducks which came from the Westward, missing both.
He next mist out they passed me at long range
and I shot down one but did not fire at the other
reserving my remaining barrel for the Coots which
 were nearly upon me. I then heard M. shout "King Eiders"
and going to my bird found it to be a ♀of that
species. It looked very large & light colored. It was 
alive& swimming so I shot it over. I did not see either
[margin] it or its companion (which M. said was a young ♂ at all
distinctly for they came to me across the dazzling  path of
sunlight on the [?] water [/margin]
