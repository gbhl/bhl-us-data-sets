[?] after small flying Diptera from the 
roof of a shed.
  A Robin, a Flicker & two young Sparrows
completed the list of birds seen on the island
but a Pigeon Hawk[?][?]ealed over it. Through
the glass we could see a dozen or more Shags 
sitting on Shag Rocks.
  In the afternoon I tried to shoot a 
Horned Grebe off the Hopper but he eluded 
me for some time. Finally I got a shot
at 50 yds. but he dove apparently before
the shot reached him and did not 
appear again.
