the river for a half-hour or more just before
and after sunset;flocks of Redwings and Bobolinks
scurrying about; Swallows flying up river to 
roost(?) but in less number than during my
last trip; and a pair of Red-tailed Hawks
flying from tree to tree over the meadow one 
following the other closely, both very noisy
screaming at frequent intervals in Harsh
tones.
  While sailing about the baby I heard
a chipmunk chucking in the wood. I 
mention the fact because it is literally 
the first and only one that I have either 
seen or heard during the past two weeks.
Yesterday I spend the afternoon in a 
[?] of wood where they swarmed in
June but I could not find a single
one.
  Picked weed still in conspicuous bloom.
Cardinal flowers flowering in many places
along the edge of the river. Yesterday I 
saw down river a tall plant with a large
and very showy pink flower;both plant 
and flower looked only like the hold holy rock.
