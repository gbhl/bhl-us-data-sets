could be shown. As a demonstration it was Very in- 
teresting. 
V. A. Saunders, field agent for the U. S. Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, gave statistics in regard to crop 
estimates, showing that it was probable that the Cape 
crop this year would be in the Vicinity of 350,000, as 
compared with a total of 195,000 barrels last year. 
The New Jersey crop is expected to be about 138,000 
barrels as compared with 140,000 last year, while the 
Wisconsin crop is expected to be 41,000 barrels, where 
it had 34,200 barrels last year. He said the hail dam- 
age of last Sunday was very slight, probably totalling 
2 or 3 per cent damage. 
It was Voted that the president should appoint a 
committee of three members to assist Mr. Saunders in 
compiling statistics. The committee will be appointed 
later, 
A resolution was passed asking the Bureau of 
Crop Estimates to have a new census made of the cran- 
berry acreage. 
The meeting was one of the most interesting that 
has been held in recent years. Altogether it was very 
helpful to the growers and much information was 
given to those present.
