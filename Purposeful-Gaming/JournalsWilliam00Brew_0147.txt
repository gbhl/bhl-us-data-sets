1888
Oct. 1.
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
A clear, still, frosty morning clouding
over by 10. A. M. and raining hard
all P. M. Returned to camp by steam-
er at 7:30 A. M. Spent morning skin-
ning birds in P. M. rowed over to Moose
Point for the evening shooting. Eight
white bellied Swallows skimming over
the water in the twilight. I shot one
and this was the only shot I fired.
Saw two flocks of Black Ducks drop
into the marsh but neither came
within range. Apparently there
were at least  three and probably
four flocks. The Steamer hands
also saw five Phalaropes yesterday near 
Metallud Island.
