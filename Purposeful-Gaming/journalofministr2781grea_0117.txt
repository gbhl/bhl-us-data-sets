1920.] THE DORSET ARTS AND CRAFTS ASSOCIATION. 771 
Association as a token of her appreciation of work carried on in 
difficult times. 
Each succeeding year the Association has grown in its useful- 
ness to the county. Many of the handicrafts travel far, even 
to America and Canada, while awards have been gained at the 
Home Arts Association's Exhibition in London and at other 
centres. The joy of creation is becoming a real stimulus in 
the minds of the workers, who take a delight in producing a 
new toy or in designing a fresh pattern, and eagerly look for- 
ward to the judges' " reports " upon the meritorious articles. To 
advertise the dignity of labour and self-help and to encourage 
neatness in execution are the aims of the Association, and each 
year shows considerable advance in this direction. The happi- 
ness of those who produce and also of those who work with and 
for them has a moral influence which all must feel who are 
really interested in what concerns the good of others, and what 
certainly contributes to the prosperity of a Nation.
