Oct.16
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
  Clear and much warmer with soft S.W. wind, quite
the mildest day, in fact, that we have had for
two weeks or more.

  As we left the Brown Farm at about 8 o'clock
the morning was simply perfect, the river calm,
the air wonderfully clear, the sun warm. For
the first mile or two we saw nothing more
interesting than a muskrat swimming across
the stream. On reaching one of the "cut offs"
Melvin pulled his boat across while we kept on
around the loop. As we rounded a bend we
saw a mink dart back from a rock, where
he had been sitting in the sun, and disappear
in a hole under the bank. He soon peeped
out again from another hole and I shot
at his head but failed to kill him and we saw
him no more. The bank was fairly honey combed
with holes and runs ways which were pervaded 
with the strong odor peculiar to minks & weasels.
As we were looking in these holes a Sharp Shinned
Hawk came scaling past within a few yards
of the boat. I shot both barrels at him but failed
to get him.

  On reaching the lower landing we went on shore
on the right bank and beat a large alder [cover?]
for Woodcock. Found no signs of them here but
a little below in a springy [?] of low alders
intermixed with young larches we started two
of which M. killed one and I the other.
I saw my bird on the ground ahead of
the dog. It was not squatting but was standing
