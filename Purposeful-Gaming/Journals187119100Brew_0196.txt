1886
Aug. 30
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Cloudy and cool with occasional light showers;
wind N.E.
  Starting immediately after breakfast I climbed
Ripley's Hill and descended to the swamp at it
eastern base. On the hill itself I could not find
a bird of any kind-the first time that this has
happened. In the swamp I heard birds chirping
and quickly called out a small mixed flock
consisting of 8 Chickadees, 3 Yellow Warblers, 2 Redstarts
(both young) and a Wilson's Black-cap. I shot the 
latter and two of the Yellow Warblers.

  Besides this flock these were a few single
birds scattered through the swamp, among them
a Water Thrush, Black-poll, Parula, and several
Wilson's Thrushes, Brown Thrashers, and Catbirds.
  After ransacking the place pretty thoroughly and 
firing a number of shots. I was on my way out
when entering a small opening I saw something
move under blueberry bush within five yards
of me.  Looking closely I made out the form of a large
Fox who was standing perfectly still tail towards
me, looking back at me over his shoulder. He seemed
to be guant, pale and faded in color and thinly furred
and was doubtless the same animal seen there
on the 28th. After watching him a moment I
fired a pinch of dust shot at his rump from my
22 cal. auxiliary, this experiment proved a 
decided success for a I rarely wanted to see him
run and he ran.

  Not fifty yards further on I flushed a brood
of about eight Grouse, all fine larger birds.
