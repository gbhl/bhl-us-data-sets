1888
Sept. 18
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Cloudy with heavy rain all A.M. wind S.E.
To outlet at 8 A.M.  Skillings, King and Hill
were ahead of us but they passed a Curlew
N. hudsonicus which stood on a mud flat
I fired both barrels at it and after flying
100 yds it dropped dead on the further
shore. Next a Butte head and a Golden Plover
passed I called them within range and
shot both barrels but missed. They afterwar-
ds came back (one with a broken leg)
and I shot both sitting. Skillings and
Hill killed two Greater Yellow-legs on
Moose Point. Crocker's sons shot two Red
Phalarope in the Lake off Moose Point.
and gave me one of them. In P.M. crui-
sed under sail in my canoe looking
for Phalaropes but found none.
