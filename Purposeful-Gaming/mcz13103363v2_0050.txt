THURSDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1866.
Clear but quite cold. Took a
ride on my horse through Brook-
line while Dan went in father's
carriage. When we got home
we picked most of the grapes.
Dan went into Boston this A.M.
& saw about forty gulls probably herring.

FRIDAY 26
Cloudy & cold. We were given our
places in the club. Dan & I rode
up to Fresh Pond this P.M. & set
all my traps. Sent a boat partly across.
Saw the first surf duck in the market
today & also a wood duck.

SATURDAY 27
Alternately cloudy & clear. We got up
at 4 A.M. but as it rained we
did not start till five. Did not
fire at anything. Had a pair in one
trap & brought them all home. Played
ball nearly all A.M. Late in P.M.
father carried Dan home. Heard a
purple finch in A.M.

Sunday, October 28, 1866.
Clear & rather warm for the season.
Went to church & sabbath school in
A.M. My aunt & uncle went to
church with me. In P.M. read.
Was obliged to study all the evening.
Heard a yellow crowned warbler &
a wh[i]t[e] thr[oa]t[ed] sparrow, creepers & g[o]l[den] cr[e]st[ed]
wrens are getting thick. Chickadees are
very so.

MONDAY 29
Cloudy all day & very gloomy. They
shortened our Greek lessons which
have hitherto been very long. When I
got home I found Dan here & I
rode home with him. Came back
by the Hoffs place. The grapes are
all gone nearly all the leaves are off
& the snow birds are getting them.

TUESDAY 30 
A.M. gusty & rainy. At 1.30
it stopped raining & blew almost
a hurricane. P.M. moderately calm
& cloudy. Played ball in our pasture
in P.M. I studied as usual in
the evening. Got up at 5 to study.
