May 16
Oden, Michigan.
Clear and cold. Ther. only 44[degrees] at noon. Water from last night.
  I awoke at daylight this morning and heard a Loon
calling on the Lake; also a Gull (L. argentatus). A Song sparrow
was the only singing bird. Probably it was too cold for
the Robins of which I saw several about the house later
in the day.
  After breakfast Dwight went to Petosky leaving me
alone through the day. He took the train out to Harbor
View and on the way saw several Scarlet Tanagers along
the beach. One, startled by the train, flew upward when
it was instantly seized in mid air by a small Hawk
probably A. fuscus.
  Not being able to get my trunk and having a
bad cold I kept in or near the house all day & did
not shoot at all. Took several short walks and saw
several D. palmarum, one D. tigrina, a yellowish P. erythromelas
(which I finally shot), several Hel. peregrina and a number
of D. coronata. The Tanager and most of the Warblers were
in the open on the ground. The Tanager late in the
afternoon spent over an hour in a ploughed field in
front of the house. He hopped almost precisely like a
Robin.
  The woods are perfectly leafless, the maple blossoms
just falling, spring beauty, arbutus, and dog-tooth violets
in bloom, willows hung with pussies, a shrub like
an elder the only thing showing green leaves. 
  On the edge of the clearing I started a Grouse from
some blackberry bushes. Several nests have been already
found here, we are told, one, yesterday containing
five eggs.
  A man saw about 25 pigeons this morning in some
