1889
(Sept. 14)
on the tops of the tall trees. There were several Blue jays
and one Canada Jay with them all frolicking together
apparently on the most friendly terms. I landed &
pursued them but could not overtake them.
At the lake House we spent about an hour beating
for Woodcock going over all the grounds but failing
to find any birds or even signs. Song Sparrows very 
numerous in the bog behind the barn. Several Flickers
in the clearing. A single Pine Linnet. Crossbills (Red) 
piping incessantly.

  At about 2 p.m. we started down river. Landing 
near the second bird we beat the floating island marsh
without finding anything. Saw some old Snipe signs.
Next tried the lower marsh near the brook. Ten Snipe 
rose one after another several hundred yards ahead
and closing in together flew in great circles high in
air for fifteen or twenty minutes. At length they
descended and darted past us. We both fired together
and dropped one. Then they alighted. Spelman flushed
one which came past me and which I shot. A moment
later I flushed and killed another. The seven remaining
birds disappeared up river. We followed and finally
found them near the floating island. they rose wild
but one dropped in the grass. Spelman flushed & missed
it. It came past me & I missed. Then a flock of
ten Wood Ducks came over me, too high probably, for
I gave them both barrels in vain. We then went back
to the lower marsh & flushed five Snipe. I killed two
& missed a third. Spelman missed four shots. It was
nearly dark at the time. S. killed a Carolina Rail 
of which we saw four in all.
