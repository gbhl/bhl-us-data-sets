their lithological resemblance and from the occurrence of traps 
with both. The southern junction of these bedded rocks with 
the granites and gneisses forming the Greenland coast to the 
southward was not seen, but at Foulke fiord and at Cape Isabella 
the northern contact is quite plain. In both places the bedded 
series, for some considerable distance from the contact, has been 
tilted and fractured, while near the contact the sandstones and 
limestones appear to have been changed into quartzite and 
crystalline limestones by the injection of great masses of 
granite. This granite seen at Cape Sabine and Cape Herschel 
is an ordinary Laurentian granite, and in no way resembles the 
acidic rocks of Tertiary or Post-Tertiary age, which they should 
do if the bedded series were of the age assigned to them by Dr. 
Sutherland. The sandstones, limestones and their associated 
traps bear a close resemblance to portions of the Huronian 
series found on Hudson bay and in the interior of Labrador. 
There is also a similarity between their contacts with the Lau- 
rentian granite and some of the contacts found in those more 
southern localities. No fossils have as yet been found in these 
rocks, and until such are found it is thought best to remove this 
series from the Tertiary and place it in the Huronian. 
on the past voyage the coast of Ellesmere island was lost 
sight of about twenty miles south of Cape Isabella, and no land 
was again seen on the west side of Baffin bay until Philpots 
island, lying off the east end of !North Devon, was reached, Where 
the ship passed sufficiently close to the small outlying islands to 
show that they were composed of Laurentian gneisses and 
granites. from thence similar rocks were seen forming the 
southern shores of north Devon as far as the west side of 
Croker bay, where they begin to sink slowly to the westward, 
and are capped by a considerable thickness of flat-bedded 
limestone, which rests unconformably upon the rounded surface 
of the older rocks. The Laurentian rocks finally dip below the 
sea a few miles to the westward of Cuming creek.
