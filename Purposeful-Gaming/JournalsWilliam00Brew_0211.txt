1889
Feb. 2
Enterprise, Florida.
Clear, cool in the morning, warm at noon.
  Spent the entire day hunting Quail along
the road to Orange City, starting at about
8 A. M. and getting in before sunset. We
started nine bevies and shot down thirty-five
birds of which we each shot fifteen independently,
five falling to both gun fired simultaneously.
Of these, however, six were lost as neither of the
dogs is a sure retriever. On two occasions we
both made a double shot but two birds were
lost of the first and one of the second.
The dogs worked superbly in the forenoon but
were nearly useless in the afternoon as both
became very tired. They pointed every bevy,
however, and about all the single birds.
The black dog found all but one bevy but
"Robin" backed him staunchly on each occasion.
When we stopped for lunch we discovered
these fine setters pointing a bevy of birds
within ten yards of the horses in
the dense ground palmetto. The black dog
usually drops at point.
  I shot poorly at bevies in the morning
but missed only two single birds. In the
afternoon I had only two chances, both at
bevies, & both times killed my pair of birds.
We saw many small birds. Several Florida
Jays in oak scrub, Flickers (one singing)
among the pines, a few Ground & Turtle
Doves, about fifty Meadow Larks, a
pair of Centurus and about fifty Robins.
