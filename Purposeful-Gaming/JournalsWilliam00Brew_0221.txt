1889
Feb. 8
Enterprise, Florida.
Clear and warm with occasional intervals of cloudiness.
  Started at 8 a.m. for Dago Prairie Mrs. Cory going with
us. The drive out was pleasant but uneventful. We
passed a Buteo alleni sitting on a tall stub by the
roadside and saw three Florida Jays in some oak scrub.
We reacjhed the prairie safety but as the wagon struck
the railroad track at the last crossing both whipple trees
broke. There was nothing to do but send the driver
back to Ostend with one horse to have the broken parts
mended of replaced. This took most of the day and
left us "stranded" meanwhile. Fortuneately we were at
the beginning of the Snipe ground and by beating
the ground closely over the space of twenty or thirty
acres we put up about forty Snipes of which I
killed eighteen and Cory twelve. I hunted the pointer
Nelly. She worked beautifully and made a number
of staunch points. but the report of a gun sent
her off like a shot. I accordingly attached a long
check cord to her collar and tieing the other end
about my waist had no further difficulty. She
found all my dead birds except one. I shot
rather poorly missing fully eight shots but several
of them were my long ones and others wounded
the birds slightly.
  At noon it was very warm in the sun and
Pine Warblers, Bluebirds and Flickers were in
full song for an hour or more. Meadow Larks
were also singing all over the prairie. Out a
half mile or more over the open marsh I
saw a flock of about twenty gray birds which
I took to be Sand Hill Cranes with equally large
