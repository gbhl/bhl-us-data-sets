(Nov. 8)
the forenoon, most of these "trading" between the
neck and this big hill so that we expected to find
the latter thronged with them. In this we were disap-
pointed for there were fewer birds there than at my
last visit. Still the number was large probably over
a hundred Horned Larks & perhaps fifty Snow Buntings.
They were all in the ploughed field at first but
after we had fired a few shots they scattered over
the neighboring grassy slopes. I shot twelve or
fifteen, nearly all single birds flying. I neither saw
nor heard any Longspurs to-day.
  There was a heavy sea running off shore & breaking
on the bar. Many Gulls scaling about. A seal at
the base of the hill. Coots and Sheldrake flying in
small bunches. Two Sparrows on the hill, perhaps
Savannas but I could not make sure. A single
Titlark. Six Colaptes in a bushy hollow, all exceedingly
wild. A single Cormorant (G. dilophus flying high
following the shore.

  Returning through the sand hills I shot three P. princeps
(included in the twelve previously mentioned) my last shot
beign the double.
  Started up river at 4 P. M. picking up Denton at
the neck. He had bagged a dozen birds, ten Horned
Larks, one Snow Bunting, & one Ereunetes pusillus. The
latter was accompanied by another Sandpiper which
D. took to be of the same species. Both were very shy.

  We has a delightful row up river in the twilight.
The tide was very high but falling fast & hence against
us but by taking advantage of the eddies we made
rapid progress. Near the second bend of the river we
saw a Bittern flapping low over the marsh.
