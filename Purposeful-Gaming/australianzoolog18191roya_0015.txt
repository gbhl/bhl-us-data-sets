BEHAVIOUR OF THYLOGALE BILLARDIERI 
outside the enclosure, sometimes with the aid of 6 X 30 binoculars. Individual 
animals were readily recognised by combinations of characteristic facial markings, 
coat colour and size. In addition, each animal had a Zoo registration number on 
an eartag; in this report these numbers are used to identify individuals. The duration 
of observation periods varied between 30 minutes and 180 minutes, with the 
majority being about 90 minutes. Initially, observations were made at various 
times of the day, but as it was found that activity was greatest in the late afternoon, 
observations were later concentrated in this period. 
RESULTS 
(1) Daily Activity Pattern: 
Pademelons are said to be crepuscular in habits, emerging from cover during 
dusk and early mornings to feed (Troughton, 1965). Limitations of the Zoo study 
did not allow this aspect of activity to be analysed. However, there was often 
activity - grooming and grazing - in the mid-morning and always in the late 
afternoon. During periods of inactivity the animals assumed a resting posture and 
often slept for periods of more than an hour. Diurnal activity appeared to vary 
with daily weather pattern and season, with greatest activity occurring on cool 
and cloudy days. 
A preference for shade was normally shown, the animals moving into direct 
sunlight only when grazing. However this preference altered with season, being 
most marked in summer. On two occasions (July 25 and September 24) some 
pademelons were observed lying stretched out in the sun. 
(2) Body Postures: 
When asleep or resting, the pademelons adopted a characteristic pose 
( Fig. 1 ) . The tail was thrust forward between the hind legs and the head rested 
on the tail. In general this attitude was adopted with the back to a tree or fence, 
although depressions in the ground were sometimes used. 
The lying-down pose characteristic of the red kangaroo (Russell, 1970a) was 
rarely adopted, and then only when lying in the sun in winter. 
During rain the pademelons adopted a semi-upright stance, with tail extended 
posteriorly and head thrust forward. 
(3) Locomotion: 
The hopping gait of the pademelon is basically similar to that of other 
small macropodids, but shows some differences. Pademelons hold their forelegs 
against the chest, and their gait is not markedly saltatorial. When alarmed they 
showed great speed and agility. 
The walking gait was employed when grazing or when a male was "inspecting" 
females (see Sexual Behaviour). Unlike the red kangaroo (Russell, 1970a), the tail 
is not used as a support during walking.
