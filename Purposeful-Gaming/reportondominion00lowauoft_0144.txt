1902. The great land masses of the Arctic islands have now 
been outlined, and all that remains to be done is to fill in minor 
details. 
The acquirement by Spain of all the richer parts of America 
followed close on the discovery of Columbus; at the same time 
Portugal laid claim to the southern route, by the Cape of Good 
Hope, to India and China, in consequence of the discoveries of 
vasco da Gama. 
England was thus debarred from these new fields of wealth, 
and it was the search for a northern and unclaimed passage to 
the East which stimulated, in the reign of Elizabeth, the 
awakening enterprise of London and Bristol merchants to outfit 
expeditions under brave and adventurous seamen. 
The first attempt was made to the eastward, around the 
northern coasts of Europe and Asia. Although failing in the 
main object, a large and profitable trade was opened with 
northern Russia, which led to the founding, by Sebastian Cabot, 
of the Muscovy Company of London in 1553. 
This company, through selfish motives, was unfavourable to 
the prosecution of a search for a northern passage to the west-

In that year Sir Martin Frobisher, filled with enthusiasm by 
accounts of a mythical Strait of Anian, which was said to afford 
a safe passage between the Atlantic and Pacific, through the 
north temperate regions of America, resolved to explore the 
strait. Aided by powerful friends, he overcame the opposition 
of the Muscovy Company, and under the direct patronage of the 
Queen, he succeeded in outfitting three small clumsy vessels, 
two being of twenty-five tons burden each, the third being a 
pinnace of ten tons. These he provisioned for twelve months, 
and with the combined crews, numbering thirty-five persons, 
sailed from the Thames. High pinnacle land, covered with 
snow, was seen on the 11th of July, in n. latitude 61. off
