guess at most of them and shoot them at
random. By shooting freely and hearing their
songs we found that [delete]they[/delete] there were numerous Vireo
olivaceus, Parula am, D. blackburniai, D. virens,
D. striiata and D. caerulescens with a fair sprinkling
of D. castanea, D. striata, Hel. peregrina & Myio[?]
canadensis. (the latter in the highest tops at times).
  Wood Thrushes were very numerous here. We must
have seen & heard at least a dozen. We also
saw three Sitta carolinensis, two [?] [?]
a pair of Certhia am, a few Sphyrapicus & Picus
villosus and a [female] Hylotomus (which D. shot). Tanagers
and Grosbeaks were singing on every side.
  After lunch we explored a low-lying rather
swampy portion of these woods. There were more
hemlocks here and many gigantic elms. In
one of the latter in a fork about 70 ft. up I
discovered the nest of a Buteo borealis. As we
approached the spot one of the birds began uttering
its curious gasping cry which D. compared to the
neighing of a horse. It flitted from tree to tree
keeping out of shot. The other bird was on the
nest from which it started when D. struck the
base. It alighted within thirty yards & seemed
to have little fear of us. We could not climb to the nest.
  In a swampy place at the very foot of a large
hemlock I found the nest of a Grouse. The bird
flew from it as I brushed past alighting a few
rods off & mewing. When I returned later she flew
at 15 yds. distance and sped away until lost
to sight among the trees. 10 eggs - one cracked by
the bird's hurried flight probably. On the way home
about sunset I shot at & missed a Buteo p[?]
which was sitting on a stub by the shore.
