just over the center of the lodge, where an opening 
about two feet in diameter was left as a smoke-hole. 
Long willow rods, closely spaced, were laid transversely 
over the rafters, and these in turn were covered with a 
thick layer of bunch grass. The sides of the lodge were 
built of timbers whose lower ends were planted in a 
trench, while their upper ends leaned against the cross 
beams of the outer uprights. The whole lodge was 
then covered with earth and sod. 
The entrance was protected by a covered way, 
built like the lodge, which extended out from it. In all 
but one of the Skidi villages this entrance faced the 
east. In the center of the floor there was a circular 
fire-pit surrounded by a slight embankment. At the 
west side of the lodge, opposite the entrance, a space 
was always reserved. This space was called wiharu, 
the garden of the Evening Star, and was considered 
sacred. In it a buffalo skull was placed, facing the 
entrance, and above it the sacred bundles and other 
religious paraphernalia of the family were hung. 
Around the north and south sides of the lodges, sleeping 
platforms were built. These platforms were made of 
poles whose inner ends rested on the earth ledge, while 
their outer ends were supported by forked posts and 
beams. Over the poles were laid willow mats, coarse 
rush mats, and lastly tanned buffalo-skins. Each bed 
was screened off from those adjoining by willow mats. 
A lodge of ordinary size would have from eight to 
ten beds on a side. Those next the altar, which were 
considered most honorable, were occupied by the older 
children. Next were the beds of the aunts and uncles, 
then those of the parents, and lastly those of the old 
people. As many as ten families, all related by blood, 
sometimes occupied a single house. The sleeping plat- 
forms and other furniture were removed when the 
lodge was to be used for ceremonies, and are not 
shown in the miniature group.
