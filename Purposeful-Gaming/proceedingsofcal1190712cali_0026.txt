are neither specimens or notes of a species from a given 
locality in the collection under consideration. 
The collections of vascular plants were identified by myself 
at the Gray Herbarium of Harvard University under the 
direction of Dr. B. L. Robinson, Curator of the Gray 
Herbarium. I wish here to express my thanks to Dr. 
Robinson for his kindness in giving me free access to 
the excellent collections of plants from the Galapagos Islands 
which are in the Gray Herbarium, as well as for advice and 
assistance in innumerable places, rendered doubly valuable 
on account of his intimate knowledge of the flora of these 
islands. Dr. Robinson has also been kind enough to read and 
criticise the manuscript and to give advice about the arrange- 
ment of the same. I wish also to express my thanks to Dr. 
W. G. Farlow of Harvard University for identifying the 
lichens and mosses, and to Miss Mary A. Day, Librarian of 
the Gray Herbarium, for assistance in looking up the rather 
large amount of literature made necessary in revising the 
nomenclature. I wish further to acknowledge the kindness 
of Prof. M. L. Fernald of the Gray Herbarium for assistance 
in many places, of Mr. Casimir de Candolle of Geneva, Switz- 
erland, for assistance on Peperomia, of Mr. A. S. Hitchcock 
of the U. S. Department of Agriculture for aid in regard to 
the Gramineae, of Mr. H. D. House for assistance in the 
identification of some of the members of the Convolvulaceae, 
of Mr. W. H. Ochsner, geologist of the expedition, and Mr. 
E. W. Gifford, joint ornithologist of the expedition, for infor- 
mation about their particular subjects, and of Mr. H. H. 
Bartlett of the U. S. Department of Agriculture for assistance 
in translating many of the descriptions of the new species, 
varieties, and forms into Latin.
