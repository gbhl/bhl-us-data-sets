MEMBERSHIP AND DUES 
Any person interested in promoting cranberry culture, or any 
business pertaining thereto, is eligible as a member of the corpora- 
tion. 
The dues shall be one dollar for a year, or any fraction there- 
of, payable to the quarter on or before the annual meeting. 
All candidates for membership shall sign an application (which 
must be accompanied by dues of one dollar for the balance of the 
year to the next annual meeting) to the Board of Directors, and, 
if approved by the directors at any meeting held for that purpose, 
or by written approval of at least seven of the directors, he shall 
be enrolled as a member. 
The Cape COd Cranberry Growers' Association will be found 
to be of mutual benefit to all those who are in any way connected 
with the industry and all such are urged to become members. A 
strong association is necessary for the best interests of the busi- 
ness, and you should all, who are not now members, join at once 
and help the cause along.
