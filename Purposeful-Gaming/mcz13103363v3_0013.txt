  Clear and rather warm in the
middle of the day. This morning 
and evening about 10[degrees]. Rode
down to the colledges on the 
same pung that I catch almost
every morning. In P.M. Dick

little while on Spark's St.
Then went over to Mt. Auburn
St. and got several rides.
Saw four snow buntings in
the usual place. Came
back up Sparks St. on a
pung and coasted some time
on E. [?] double runner.
Was late to dinner. Went
up to the Russells in the
evening about my Caesar.
Went to bed as usual at 10.

  Clear and the snow melted
slightly in the mn. At 8 A.M.
ther. at 2[degrees], at 9 P.M. 10[degrees]. Got
no rides either coming from

most of the P.M. on Spark's
St. but once on Concord
Avenue. Also got two rather
short ride on pungs. Took
a number of coasts on E.
Dudge's double runner
Did not get up to the Russells
in the evening but worked
the Latin out myself.
Was late to dinner. The
sleighing still continues
very good although it is
getting a little worn. 
Saw four goldfinches.
