1889
(Nov. 25)
all the birds I found there but in the birches beyond
the spring meadow to the north I came upon a large
flock of Redpolls - fully 100 birds - feeding. I first shot
into them at random killing four linaria. They
alighted again not far off. I then got nearly under
them and picking out one of the largest killed it
with the auxiliary. It proved to be a typical A. rostiata
There were four or five more equally big and doubtless
of the same form.
  During the day I did not see a single Robin
or Junco. There was a Song Sparrow chirping in
the meadow near the spring which I was after
the Redpolls. I neither heard nor saw any Pine Grosbeaks.
If they are really here I cannot imagine what
they find to eat as there are literally no cedar
or mountain ash berries this autumn. The Redpolls
are well provided for as the gray birches have an
abundant crop of seeds.
