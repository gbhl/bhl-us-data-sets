BEARS THE FIRST SEASON 
Plants of St. Regis planted in early April gave ripe berries on the 20th 
of June of the same year. For four weeks thereafter the yield was heavy and the 
canes continued to produce ripe fruit freely without intermission until the middle of 
October. The berries were large and beautiful, firm and full flavored, to the very 
last. 
St. Regis is the only Raspberry, thus far known, that will yield a crop of 
fruit the season planted. 
Awarded a certificate of merit by the AMERICAN INSTITUTE of New 
York.
