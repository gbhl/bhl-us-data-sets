Friday, January 25, 1867
 Clear. Cloudy in the evening.
Rode down to school with father
in A.M. and took in most of 
the boys'. Coming home from
school got a ride from the
Colledges to Williard St. Had
my name sent up to Mr Rolfe
for throwing snow balls.
 In P.M. stuffed the remaining
male redpoll shot Wednesday.
 In the evening went up to the 
Russells but Theo was not at 
home so I got out my Latin at home
as best I could. Before breakfast
saw about 25 robins on our
cedar tree. A boy said that
he saw numbers of blue jays
two days ago but I have seen
none lately. There is [?] sufficient 
to bear a sled.
