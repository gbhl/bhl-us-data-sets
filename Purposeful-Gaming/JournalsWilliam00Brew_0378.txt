Sept. 21
Cloudy with frequent heavy showers. Wind N.W.
  Spelman and Chadbourne spent the day shooting going to Sunday
Cove and Rapid River. They saw a flock of fully 150 Black Ducks 
in Brandy Ledge Cove and seven Wood Ducks in Rapid River. 
They killed nothing but a Carolina Rail.

  Late in the afternoon Jim rowed me to Moose point. 
I took a station on the east bank and after waiting
for some time got a long shot at a Black Duck which 
after flying about 100 yards dropped dead. We went after
him when swarms of Black Ducks began coming in from
every direction. Within ten minutes fully 150 must
have arrived. Nearly all of them scaled down and
alighted in the flooded meadow. We paddled to the
nearest flock and as they rose I fired at one missing
it but the next moment killing another very dead with
the second barrel. This was my first Black Duck
shooting with the new 20 gauge. All the Ducks went
out of the marsh at these shots. Besides the Black
Ducks I saw four Wood Ducks come in, one, a drake,
in apparently full plumage.

Sept. 22
Clearing with alternating showers and sunshine. Wind blowing
a raging gale from the N.W. Very cold water freezing at night.
  Started shooting at about 8 a.m. Went first to Moose Point
where we paddled over the flooded meadow starting two
Carolina Rails but nothing else. Will Sargent who was with
Spelman killed a fine Winter Yellow-leg which was sitting
on an isolated mud lump.
  Next through Leonard's Pond. In the channel north of
the island found a flock of over 200 Wood Ducks, most of
them near the old fir top. I was about to land
and stalk them when I saw a man emerge from the bushes
