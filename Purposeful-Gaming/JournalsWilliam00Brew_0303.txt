May 31
Watertown, Mass.
Clear and warm with strong S.W. wind.
  To the Coolidge farm with Denton at 3.30 p.m. to find,
if possible, the nest of the pair of House Wrens shot there
on the 29th. In this we failed although D. climbed to &
examined every hole that we could discover in the old
orchard. He also inspected the Least Flychatcher's nest which
I found on the 29th but it proved empty.
  While looking for nests in this orchard, Denton spied
a Yellow-billed Cuckoo's nest in an apple tree not thirty yards
from where I took a set of eggs many years ago. On
climbing to it he found it contained two young birds
nearly half grown and two eggs. We left it undisturbed.
  In the upper apple tree I discovered a Redstarts nest
with the bird on. It held four eggs besides one of a 
Cow Bunting. We took nest and eggs.
  My Indigo bird was sitting on three eggs. She left
the nest when i was about ten yards off and chirped
at me anxiously. I did not molest her treasures.
  Passing the Nuthatch's nest we saw the female chirping
to the trunk just below the hole. Afterwards I
watched the tree for several minutes but no birds 
appeared.
  The bad small boy evidently continues to burst bird's
eggs in this orchard for I saw a fresh Oriole's nest
attached to the branch which had been broken off &
left in the top of the tree, the withered leaves showing
that it had been detached several days ago at least.
  Counted seven Bank Swallows at the sand bank
& watched them for some time playing about &
entering holes. Few birds singing this
