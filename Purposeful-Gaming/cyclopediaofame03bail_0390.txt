shaddock.-although botanically the Pomelo and 
Shaddock are of one species, as known horticulturally in 
Jamaica they are very different. The Shaddock is a 
smaller tree than the Pomelo, with larger leaves, but 
the greatest difference is in the fruit. Whilst one is 
an esteemed and valuable dessert fruit, the other is 
hardly ever used, and is not exported. There are 
two varieties of shaddock,-one with a globose fruit 
and flesh of a pale color, the other pear-shaped, with 
crimson flesh. In both, the fruits are very large, often 
weighing 15 or 16 pounds; the rind is exceedingly 
thick, the vesicles are large and distinct, but the flesh 
is dry and coarse, except in occasional varieties. The 
Shaddock is said to have been brought to the West 
Indies by Captain Shaddock. 
Hog shaddock.-this variety is very like the pear- 
shaped Shaddock in appearance, and it is probably a 
hybrid between the Shaddock and the citron, or the 
rough lemon. It is of no value whatever as a fruit, 
being intensely bitter, but it is used for the purpose of 
cleaning floors to kill fleas, which are troublesome in 
some houses at certain seasons of the year. The Hog 
Shaddock is said to make an excellent stock on which to 
bud Pomelo. w. Harris. 
THE POMELO IN florida.-in no place in the world 
has the culture of the pomelo reached such perfection 
as in Florida. Indeed, the improvement of the fruit and 
extension of its cultivation in that state has led to its 
establishment as an important commercial fruit. Its 
cultivation as a market fruit has been extended from 
Florida to California and Jamaica, and it is only in these 
localities as yet, so far as the writer is informed, where 
any of its varieties are grown on a commercial scale. In 
most foreign countries the pear-shaped Pomelos, or 
Shaddocks as they are more properly called, are con- 
sidered superior to the round varieties, but in this coun- 
try the industry has been built up with the round types, 
varieties of which have been developed that are much 
sweeter and of better quality and flavor than any of the 
pear-shaped forms or Shaddocks. The good varieties 
grown for the market in Florida are almost entirely of 
native origin, though one fairly good sort-the Pernam- 
buco-was introduced from South America. 
In Florida the Pomelo is, in general, cultivated and 
manured the same as the orange. The trees grow rather 
larger than the orange, however, and should be given 
considerable space. They are ordinarily planted about 
30 feet apart. Pomelo seedlings from fruits of good 
quality usually produce good marketable fruits, but the 
differentiation of varieties has progressed far enough 
so that advanced horticulturists recommend budding or 
grafting in order to secure fruit of the best quality. 
(For a short description of the varieties commonly 
grown see Citrus decumana.) The pomelo is usually 
budded either on its own stock or on that of the sweet 
orange or sour orange. Many growers think 
that it gives best results when budded on 
its own stock, and this is very extensively 
practiced in Florida. The Pomelo is more 
easily injured by cold than the orange ^^ ^ "

trees in the northern and central part of 
the state were killed to the ground since 
this time large plantings have been made in 
southern Florida, and in a few years a much 
larger crop will be produced than ever be- 
fore. Considerable quantities of the fruit 
are also being produced in California

POMOLOGY (Literally, science of fruits). 
All those subjects, both practical and scien- 
tific, that have to do with the growing of 
fruits are assembled under the term Po 
mology. It is synonymous with fruit-grow- 
ing. There has been an effort to divorce 
the terms Pomology and Fruit-growing 
making the former comprise the scientific 
and classificatory subjects and the latter the 
practical subjects; but such division is ar 
bitrary and is opposed to usage. The word 
POMOLOGY 
"growing" can no longer be held, when used in such 
connection, to designate merely the planting and care 
of fruit-plants, for all good practice is indissolubly 
associated with scientific knowledge and theory. Fruit- 
growing is a more familiar and homely term than the 
latin-greek word Pomology, and for that reason it has 
seemed to some persons 
fruits. it is significant, 
however, that with the 
ception 
prince's 
Po- 
mological Manual," none of 
the fruit books that have 
done much to mold public 
opinion been known as Pomologies, 
notwithstanding the fact 
that the greater number of 
them have given great at- 
tention to formal descrip- 
tions of varieties. the 
word that was used generically for "fruit." In later 
Latin it came to be associated more particularly with 
the apple-like fruits. The word is preserved to us in the 
french pomme, meaning "apple, "and in other languages 
of Latin derivation. In English we know it as pome, a 
botanical term used to designate fruits that have the 
peculiar morphological structure of the apple and pear. 
This use of the term is explained under the article py- 
rus. A pome is shown in Fig. 1889. The "core," inside 
the light dotted line, is the ripened carpels; the flesh, 
outside this line, is the thickened torus or receptacle, on 
the top of which the calyx or "eye " is borne. However, 
the root of the word Pomology is derived from the Latin 
pomum rather than from the botanical pome. 
The limitations of pomology, as an art and science, 
depend on the use of the word "fruit." This word, as 
used by the horticulturist, is impossible of definition. 
Products that are classed with fruits in one country 
may be classed with vegetables in another. To the 
horticulturist a fruit is a product that is closely asso- 
ciated, in its origin, with the flower. As used in this 
country, a fruit is the product of a bush or tree or 
woody vine, the most marked exception being the straw- 
berry. Most fruits may be grouped under three gen- 
eral heads,-orchard or tree fruits, vine fruits {of 
which the grape is the type), and small fruits. Of the 
orchard fruits, the leading groups are the pome fruits 
(apples, pears, etc.), drupe fruits (peaches, plums, 
cherries, etc.), and the citrous fruits (oranges, lemons, 
etc.). The species of fruits that are fairly well known 
in North America are not less than 150. but the impor- 
tant commercial species are not more than 40.
