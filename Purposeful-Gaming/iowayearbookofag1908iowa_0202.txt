Board met with all members present. 
The President stated that the purpose of the meeting was to give 
a hearing to various representatives of publications, who desired to 
present to the Board the question of permitting the solicitors of the 
various papers to work promiscuously over the grounds taking sub- 
scriptions and giving away premiums. The Board listened to the 
arguments of the various gentlemen present, after which they went 
into executive session. 
The following resolution was made and adopted with but one dis- 
senting vote : 
Resolved, That it is the belief of this board that it would not be for the . 
best interests of the fair, and would be annoying to the patrons thereof, to 
permit the subscription solitictors of the various papers to work promis- 
cuously over the grounds in taking subscriptions for their various papers; 
also that the use of premiums in connection with the taking of subscrip- 
tions should be prohibited except as may be handled at the permanent 
headquarters of such papers.
