Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Cloudy and warm with occasional light showers and steady
rain in the evening. Lake calm all day.
  Just after breakfast a [male] Picoides arcticus came about
camp and I shot it as it was flying from a birch
stub to the pine at our landing. Charlie saw a [female] in 
the same birch later.

  We spent most of the day on the Lake, Jim and
I going to Moose Pt. thence along the E. shore to
Glaspy Cove down past B. Brook Cove to the Tyler
Cove where we met Melvin by appointment at 1 P.M.
We saw three [these?] White winged Scoters flying high, a
single very shy Scaup Duck in the Lake, a flock
of over thirty Black Ducks in Glaspy Cove and
a few Sheldrake. I fired only once during the 
morning - a long shot at a Sheldrake which I
missed. In Glaspy Cove saw two Tree Sparrows and
a Robin and heard Redpoll Linnets in the air. 
Melvin had killed a young Herring Gull which 
had a sucker that would weigh at least 1/2 lb.
in its throat, the tail sticking out the bird's mouth.
It was sitting on a rock. M. also had a Chipping 
Sparrow which he picked up dead in the Lake. It
doubtless lost its way in the dense fog early 
this morning & flew in circles until exhausted.

  After lunch went to Black island Cove. I
took a station on the beach and M. went
in his boat starting two Sheldrake which
came directly over me within less than 15 ft.
I missed the first but got the other with my
second barrel.
