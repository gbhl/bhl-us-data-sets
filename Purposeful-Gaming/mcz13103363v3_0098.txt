1867
Wednesday, July 3.
  Clear but still and rather
hazy. Ther about 70 [degrees]
���84 [degrees]���76 [degrees]. Had breakfast
rather late. Walked down
to the square and then as
I had a bad side ache got
on a car & rode partway
down to school when remembering
that I had left my pocket
book at home. I got off & was
late for school. Wrote our
Greek paper. Rode home on
account of my side, getting
here at 11 A.M. Spent most
of the A.M. reading and R
Deane called in. In the
P.M. rode through Waltham
with father. Had a poultice
put on my side when I went
to bed.

Thursday, July 4,.
  A.M. clear and decidedly
the hottest weather that
we have had. Most of P.
M. cloudy and we had a 
slight thunder shower.
Lightened nearly all the
evening and had a heavy thunder
storm accompanied by the most
brilliant lightning that I ever
saw. Spent most of the A.M.
reading and sleeping. Walked up
to the head of the garden but
it hurt my side very badly.
Read the first part of the
P.M. and then took a ride
through Waverly and Belmont
with father. In the evening
watched some very brilliant
fireworks sent from the Watertown
Arsenal.
