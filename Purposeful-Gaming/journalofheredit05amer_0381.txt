SMOOTH BLACK PLANT 
This plant belonged to the same family as the one shown opposite. Six fine, downy F3 plants 
gave each in F4 about one-quarter of these black plants. This photograph was taken early 
in December, 1912, but the plant presented much the same appearance early in September. 
This particular black plant set no pods, as all its minute flower-buds, or its few flowers, 
dropped. Some of the 57 black plants (brothers or first cousins of this one) set a few pods, 
but all kept their leaves until the frost of December 26. The leaves are smooth and convex; 
all the hairs on the plant consist of black tomentum. Scale in feet. A remarkable segrega- 
tion with a single factorial difference. (Fig. 17.)
