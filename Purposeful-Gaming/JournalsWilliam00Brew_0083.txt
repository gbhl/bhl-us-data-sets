1888
June 11
Winchendon, Massachusetts.
Clear & cool with strong N. W. wind
  With H. M. Spelman took the 3.05 P. M. train for
Winchendon. At Concord we were joined by S. W. Denton
who had gone up by an earlier train to get some
nests which I found there on the 8th.
  Reaching Winchendon and taking tea at the hotel
we hired a double-seated wagon and started for
Bailey's. Martins & Night-hawks were hawking about
over the town as we left it. Reaching the woods we
found them silent & apparently deserted. In fact
during the entire distance we heard nothing but
a Robin & Song Sparrow or two. The trouble probably was
that the evening was too cold for most of the
smaller birds.
  A mile or so below Bailey's we met him on the
road & taking him in proceeded to his house.
He has done little collecting this year but showed
us a Myiarchus in the flesh, shot this morning.
  After arranging to go out to his place to-morrow
we returned to town. A Whipporwill singing near
the roadside. No Hermit Thrushes. Mosquitos numerous.
Aralia nudiflora coming into bloom & very conspicuous 
& beautiful.
