1887
(Oct. 22)
dead in an open pasture), the fourth M. snapped
at (his shell missing him) and I killed, or rather
brought down with a broken wing at fully 60 yds.
Three of these birds were in a wet, [?] run among 
birches and alders only four or five feet high, the fourth
in thin birches on a dry knoll.
  In this same [?] "Don" made several fine points 
on a Grouse which I shot at five times and wounded
badly but finally lost. Rabbits were more numerous 
here than I have ever seen them before. We started at 
least eight or ten in the space of a few acres.
  Crossing the road we next tried the old birches
on the south side, a [?] that used to be a nearly 
sure find. Near the middle "Don" pointed and a 
very large Woodcock rose wild, actually out of range in
fact. It soared over the top of a large pine and 
dropped in a flooded swamp beyond where we could
not follow. 
  Our last beat was the "Parker Lot." Scarcely had we 
entered it when a perfect fusillade of firing began on 
the the further. We next heard a Quail whistling and going
to the spot I stumbled on four birds which rose under
my feet. I killed with my first barrel and missed, or
rather wounded only, with the second. At the same moment
two young men who were following the bevy started several
other birds near us. All four guns pursued the scattered
birds until nearly dark. M. and I killed another (both
firing at once) and missed two or three shots. Our 
companions added three to the bag of four they had 
made before meeting us. 
  Don worked superbly making five points on Woodcock, 
five on Grouse, and six on Quail, flushing only one Bird
all day.
