1889
May 14
Cambridge, Belmont & Waltham, Mass.
Alternately cloudy & clear with light showers. Wind E. to S. W.; warm.
  J. Dwight Jr. appeared at 9.30 A. M. with a horse and
buggy and quickly prevailed on me to spend the day collecting.
We got off at about ten o'clock and drove directly to the
Warren Runs in Waltham. On the way we heard and saw
many Orioles, Warbling Vireos, Least Flycatchers etc. a
Meadow Lark and two Bobolinks near the Trickey place in
Waltham, a Savanna Sparrow singing in the latter locality,
a D. streata opposite the Warren place.
  Arriving at the Warren place we left the house then
and started over the usual route. The place proved
to be not materially changed save that the second
growth is denser and taller in many places. None of
the woods or thickets have been cleared since my last
visit.

  Birds were numerous as [?], very few as individuals.
We saw only two Towhees and not more than three
or four Brown Thrashers. I found a nest of the latter
on the ground well concealed under a fallen birch top.
It contained four eggs. The [female] scuttled off under my feet
& then flew. She made no noise whatever.
  Golden-winged Warblers were as numerous as I have
even found them on this ground. We saw first [males] & two
[females] of which Dwight shot a [male] and I two [males] & a [female].
I also shot down another [male] but could not find
it. Two of my specimens, a pair, I shot in the same tree
a young elm on the edge of a swampy run. I
killed the [female] first and was wrapping her up standing
directly under the tree when the [male] came into it
and began to sing not over 20 ft. above me.
  Dwight started a Screech Owl from a cedar in
