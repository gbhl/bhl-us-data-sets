1889
Nov. 26
Belmont & Waltham, Mass.
Clear and cool (ther 28 at sunrise) with strong, dry N. W. wind.
  Off at 9 A. M. driving to Prospect St. and spending the forenoon
in or near the Cotton run. Found Redpolls numerous in the
extensive tract of birches near the head of this run. They were
in smaller flocks than yesterday and shyer or more restless.
I spent much time in trying to detect specimens of A. rostrata
among them and believe that I really saw and, in fact,
shot, one but it scaled off and dropped among some oaks where
I could not gin it. I picked out and shot three adult [male]
linaria and sacrificed two or three young birds that looked
large, on the chances of their proving to be rostrata. I used
my 20 g. gun and in every case fired the auxiliary at single
birds. While following a flock of Redpolls I heard a Pine Grosbeak
and answering its whistled called it down into a birch where I
shot it. It was a [female] and had the bill gummed with some kind
of pitch.
  There were a few Robins among the birches and I came on
a little flock of five or six among scrub oaks where they kept
flying down to a spring to drink. All were silent and
reserved in manner acting like our small Hylocichla Thrushes. They
were very tame & evidently northern birds I thought.
  In the cedar woods I saw two Certhias and shot one of them.
I lunched among some pitch pines near Arlington Heights. A
large flock of Chickadees accompanied by a few Kinglets
came about and inspected me curiously. Crows cawing in
the distance. A flock of Red Crossbills whistling as they
passed high overhead.
  In one of the flocks of Redpolls were several Pine Linnets.
At 2 P. M. returned to the buggy and drove to Wellington Cam.
Saw a Downy Woodpecker on the way. Nothing in the lane
but a flock of Chickadees & Kinglets.
  Next to the Warren run entering from the north side and
