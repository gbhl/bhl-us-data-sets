Aug. 3
Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts
Morning and early afternoon hazy with thin wreaths of fog
driving in over the land before the light S. wind. Late
afternoon perfectly clear with sparkling air and light but
steady S. wind.
  Rose at 6 A.M. After breakfast walked over the land to 
the deep cut where I saw so many Night Herons during
my last visit. There were only two there this morning.
Some 10 gauge shells, recently fired, lying on the bank sufficiently
explained the shyness of these two birds and the absence
of the others! Two Lesser Yellow-legs were flying about
whistling and occasionally alighting and we heard the
distant call of Upland Plover now & then. There were a few
Peeps, Sandling & Piping Plover also and an occasional
Least or Wilson's Tern but altogether the place proved
very disappointing after my experience there a week or two
ago. We accordingly decided to go back to the lower end of 
the pond and thence down the herring ditch to the harbor.
As we were pushing off a large flock of Black Ducks
appeared, flying down the pond. There were nearly as 
many Herring & Black-backed Gulls on the said bar as
during my first visit.
  I had to paddle most of the way back as the wind
was ahead. Saw a young Marsh Hawk drop into some
reeds and rise with a small frog which it carried off
holding it gingerly in one foot. 
  I paddled and dragged the canoe through the ditch,
Spelman leaving his boat behind and walking.
Saw one or two Herons and a Kingfisher. In many
places the water had undermined the banks forming
little pocket shaped nooks with overhanging roofs. All of 
these pockets contained numbers of dead toads and
