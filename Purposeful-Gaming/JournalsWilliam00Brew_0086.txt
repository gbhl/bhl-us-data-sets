edge well down in the swamp Denton found a nest with
2 eggs of D. pennsylvanica. Two [males] of this species, a G. trichas,
and a Wilson's Thrush were singing.
  Entering a wood path that led back from the lane over a
knoll covered with pines and spruces we searched long &
carefully for nests of D. virens but in vain although several
[males] of this species were singing. Denton, however, was [?]
enough to find a nest of Mniotilta varia with 4 eggs. It was
on a steep, rocky hillside bordering a swamp. He went back
to the house for Spelman who photographed the nest
in situ. While they were at this I continued my search
for nests but found nothing. As the sun sank in the
west the wind lulled and birds sang freely for half an
hour or more. In the meadow below me a Swamp Sparrow
& several G. trichas; about its spruce-fringed edge two Canada
Warblers; in some young, thickly-growing spruces at the base of
the knoll a D. maculosa, the first heard this season; in
the distance two Hermit Thrushes and a Grouse drumming.
There was one Zonotrichia albicollis, also, a fine [male] which I
called up within a few yards.
  The woods are everywhere enlivened by clusters of
Azalea nudiflora in full bloom. It grows on dry as well
as swampy ground and, like the mountain laurel, varies
much in color the deepest-colored blossoms being especially,
if not invariably, those growing in the shade. It a superb
thing, one of the very few wild shrubs that presents a
mass of blossoms. Clintonia borealis[delete]is[/delete] the common lady's
slipper are also in flow. The mountain laurel will
not flower for some days yet.
