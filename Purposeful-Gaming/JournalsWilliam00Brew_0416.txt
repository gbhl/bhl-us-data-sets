1889
(Nov. 26)
going only through the old orchard to the edge of the
birches beyond. The sun was now nearly down to the
horizon. A Flicker in the orchard very shy calling pi-uk
and wor-r-r-roo. Some Chickadees with a Certhia which I
shot. Tree Sparrows in a birch swamp. More Redpolls, a small
flock only busily gleaning their supper. Picked out a rosy-
breasted [male] & shot him. Turning back through the orchard
I spied a Shrike perched on the topmost spray of an 
elm. As I approached he flicked his tail uneasily &
finally, just before I got within range, started off
over the open fields, swinging in long swift undulations
until out of night. Hearing a Snow Bunting I looked up
and discovered an immense flock - fully 200 - stretched
out in a broad band flying westward at a height of
about 200 ft. The setting sun brought out their black &
white coloring in sharp contrast against the blue sky. Where
could they have been going?

  I saw several small flocks of Juncos along the roadsides
in or near cedars. Has the great autumnal flight passed?
