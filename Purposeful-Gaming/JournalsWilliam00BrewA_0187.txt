July 6
Falmouth, Massachusetts
Clear and warm with pleasant S.W.[south west] breeze.
  Returned to Falmouth the night on the 4th. Yesterday afternoon
Faxon came down to pass the Sunday with us. We took a walk
in the evening past the swamp behind the Howards' but there
was no sound from the "Kicker". He was silent, also, on the night
of the 4th and has doubtless either left the place or been

we left the rest and then walked along the beach nearly
to Falmouth Heights examining two little ponds bordered narrowly
by marsh. Nothing about there. Saw a few Savanna Sparrows.
  After dinner drove over to the W.[west] Falmouth marshes. Very hot and
dusty, few birds singing. Reaching the inlet we found the tide
down and the Terns collected on a bar far out from the
sand-hills. Walked out and had a good view of them.
 The majority Wilson's with ten or a dozen Roseates among
them. Heard a Lesser Yellow-legs whistling & called the
bird overhead but it was flying very high and kept on
towards the S.
  On the way out of the marshes heard a White-eyed Vireo
scolding &[and] soon discovered a pair of these birds in a
thicket by the roadside. They evidently had young.
  Next to Long Pond. Quail whistling in the fields &
Meadow Larks & Grass Finches numerous. A Parula singing
in a white cedar swamp. Prairie Warblers & Red-eyes in
the oak woods. Near the crest of the hill over the pond
we stopped for a moment and distinctly heard a Veery calling
below us on the edge of the water. A little further on a
â™€ Ruffed Grouse ran across the road followed closely by a
