1886
Aug. 23
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and warm; a glorious day with light W. wind.
  Started early (8 o'clock) this morning with
the determination to find and kill the Prothoustary  
Warbler seen last evening on the Assabet.
[margin]Assabet River[/margin]
  Upon entering the mouth of that river I found
it at its loveliest, the calm reaches reflecting the
trees that shaded them and the sunshine lighting
up the many quiet little nooks along the banks
and bathing the black willows and button bushes
along the western shore in a flood of light.
There were a few birds chirping and flitting
about in the trees over the water, mostly Red-eyes
and Wood Peeves, but I saw nothing of any
interest for some time. Upon reaching the place
when the Prothonotary was obscured last evening
I paddled slowly and cautiously up one side
and down the other, misplacing every time and 
thicket and stopping often to watch and listen.
I had completed this circuit and was about to
make it again when I heard a small mixed
flock coming through the tree tops to the bank
on the west shore. Feeling sure that they would 
cross the river I posted myself in their path
and waited. Surreal Chickadees appeared first, then
two Yellow Warblers and some Red-eyes. These crossed
the stream and I had begun to fear that all had
gone when I saw the foliage shake in a small,
dense Incurious bicolor. A bird was evidently moving
there working slowly upward but for a long
time, he would not show himself. I waited
patiently with my pistol socked and leveled.
