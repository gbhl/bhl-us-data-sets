Oct.24
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
  Cloudy and chilly with raw S.E. to N.E. wind, fitful at
times strong.
  Early this morning Jim discovered a flock of Ducks
in the Lake near Black Island. They kept well out
in deep water and we supposed them to be Scoters
but they proved to be Sheldrake. At one time they
worked in close to shore and I landed on the back
side of the point and came very near getting a shot
at them but they soon swam out into the Lake,
again although there was a heavy sea running, and
began diving in deep water. 400 to 500 yds. from land.
At times all would be under water at once but
usually several remained on watch while the others
were below. There were 21 birds in the flock and
all appeared to be females or young males. They
frequently "bunched" but usually swam in several 
small clusters with single birds scattered between.
They kept diving in mainly one place for over
an hour but finally came in to some rocks
where they climbed out and pressed their feathers
some of them standing erect, others with the
body nearly horozontal. One clambered to the
top of a rock 4 or 5 ft. above the water where
it kept a keen lookout. I do not remember me
seeing Sheldrake fish in deep, open water before.

  The wind rose to such a degree that we
returned to camp about ten o'clock. I spent 
the remainder of the day sailing about on 
the Lake in my canoe.
  As I was eating breakfast this morning 
a Cooper's Hawk skimmed past the fire close
