of Warblers, Chickadees etc.. among which were two
Red-bellied Nuthatches. I shot one of them and
found it to be an adult male, smoothing, and in
any ragged plumage. Most of the birds in the flock
were in Mniotilta varia chiefly young already in good
fall plumage

  Returning to the river we landed next at
the wooded slope just below Ball's Hill when
we launched and spent over two hours. There
are three small beeches here, a rare tree in Concord.
These woods were apparently barren of birds; we
did not hear a song of any description while in 
them.
  The return up river late in the afternoon
was uneventful. A few Swallows and King birds
skimming over the water, A Field Sparrow singing
on Dakin's Hill, a Yellow Warbler singing on
the river bank, a great flocks of Red-wings
in the Sivania beds apparently finding one
the "race".

  Heard a Cicada, the second only this far.
