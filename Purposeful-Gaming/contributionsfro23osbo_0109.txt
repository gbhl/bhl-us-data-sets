inserting, before the arm strikes the top. The 
side arm is long enough so that the straight 
part of it more than holds the mercury column, 
when desired, and at the same time short 
enough so that when in position it lies about 
half an inch below the shoulder of the reservoir 
bottle. The proper dimensions can readily be 
ascertained by the use of a cardboard model 
and a bottle of the type it is intended to use 
as the reservoir. The glass tubing should be 
of sufficiently large bore to permit the ready 
passage of large air bubbles. 
In setting up the apparatus the feed tube is 
first shoved through the reservoir stopper from 
below and the atmometer stopper affixed to its 
upper end in the usual way. Next, enough 
mercury is placed in the crook at the bottom 
of the tube to completely block the passage. 
The whole thing is then carefully turned up- 
side down, in such a way that the mercury col- 
umn runs out of the J and into the side-arm. 
With mercury and tube in this position the 
atmometer, filled with water, is attached (or it
