192 cruise of THE neptune 
The rocks of the south coast of the strait Westward from Cape 
Chidley, as examined by Mr. Caldwell, show that large masses 
of red and pink mica and mica-hornblende-granite, in a more or 
less foliated condition, occupy the greater part of the coast area. 
These granites are newer than the other crystalline rocks asso- 
ciated with them, which they have inclosed and altered. 
The older rocks are largely of basic igneous origin, and vary in 
composition from anorthosites almost free from bisilicates, to 
hornblendic and chloritic schists containing very little feldspar. 
A series of light-coloured, high quartzose gneisses is also found, 
and probably represents altered bedded rocks associated with 
the basic igneous ones. 
The basic rocks and the light-coloured gneisses are pene- 
trated by many large dikes of pegmatite from the granites. In 
many places these dikes are very quartzose, and where they cut 
the basic masses often contain pyrite and give indications of 
other minerals. Associated with the lighter gneisses are large 
long masses of rock, which carry in places considerable quanti- 
ties of graphite, in others an impure iron ore. The study of 
these bands has not been sufficient to pronounce as to Whether 
they are veins or beds. 
Ancient crystalline rocks occupy the entire coast-line from 
the mouth of George river at Ungava bay to Cape Wolstenholme 
at the eastern entrance to the strait. Mica-granite and, in less 
quantities, mica-hornblende granite, both more or less foliated, 
occur along the greater length of this coast. In many places 
these granites are associated with other gneisses, which are 
usually lighter in colour, finer in texture, and contain more 
quartz than the eruptive granite. These lighter gneisses usually 
are garnet-bearing, the crystals of that mineral being often of 
large size. In a greater number of places the gneisses of these 
two series are so closely mingled as to render a separation im- 
possible; but there are localities, notably along the West side of
