Blackburnian Warblers. A Black Throated Blue War-
bler, the only one detected near Ashby was
singing in [delete]the[/delete] a swamp [delete]beneath[/delete] where there
was an abundance of mountain laurel.
Faxon left me here and attempted to pene-
trate through this swamp, but he found
it so difficult that he only crossed one end
of it, and merging into a road beyond
reached the house nearly as soon as I
did. I went back over the same ground
which we took on our walk out, cross-
ing the brook, however, a little lower down.
Saw a Green Heron flying up this brook
at sunset.
  In the evening the Hensloe's Sparrow
was singing in the meadow near the house
as usual.
