A LARGE BRANCH FROM A SHRUB OF Eleagnus pungens var. Frederici variegata (Servettaz), 
WITH VARIEGATED FOLIAGE 
The foliage on this plant is normally solid green in color, but variegated forms have originated 
as bud variations. The three upper small branches in the illustration are shown sporting back to 
the solid green leaf color of the type of this species. At the bottom is a twig which has leaves of 
the solid green color along one side and variegated leaves along its opposite side. (Fig. 20.)
