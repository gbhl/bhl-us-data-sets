HISTORICAL SUMMARY 91 
the party, reinforced by a number of Canadian voyageurs, 
started northward in canoes, and reached Fort Chipewyan, 
on Great Slave lake, before the ice had melted. The expedi- 
tion, now consisting of twenty-five persons, started away 
from Fort Chipewyan with one day's supply of provisions and 
a totally inadequate amount of ammunition. Travelling to the 
north side of the lake, the party was further increased by a band 
of the Copper Indians, and all journeyed to Fort Enterprize, 
which was built near the edge of the barren lands, in latitude 
64 30' N". The total distance travelled during this season was 
1,350 miles. Venison was plentiful during the winter, but the 
supply failed in the spring, so that a start was made over the 
barrens without any food except such as fell to the hunters from 
day to day. The distance from Fort Enterprize to the mouth 
of Coppermine river is 334 miles. The first 120 miles were 
made by tramping with canoes and outfit over the snow; the 
remainder was made in canoes, and the mouth of the river was 
reached on the 21st of July. Turning eastward, the shores of 
Bathurst inlet and Coronation gulf were surveyed to Point 
Turnagain, in latitude 68 19' N. and longitude 109 25' W. 
the canoes were detained here for several days by a snowstorm, 
and a retreat was necessary as soon as the weather moderated. 
The course along the coast was therefore retraced to Hood river, 
and that stream was ascended for a short distance. The equip- 
ment was reduced to the smallest compass, and a course was 
shaped overland for Fort Enterprize, the travelling being 
through deep snow. Game was very scarce, and the hardships 
soon began to tell on the weaker members of the party, with the 
result, as before stated, that half the number succumbed to cold 
and starvation. The survivors were succoured by Indians on 
the 7th of November, and reached the Hudson's Bay post on 
Great Slave lake on the 11th of December, and England in 
October, 1822.
