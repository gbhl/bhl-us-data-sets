pistol had been shooting badly, owing, as we afterwards
discovered, to the sights being wrongly adjusted.
  After dinner we started out again and shot until
nearly tea time I getting just twenty birds more or
forty for the full day. In addition to those killed I 
saw a Lincoln's Finch distinctly. It was in a fallen tree
top from which I could not dislodge it. Also saw a
Sparrow which looked like an immature T. [?].
  During the day I killed 15 D. palmarum & Dwight
7. We must have seen over 30. They were nearly all
on the ground in the open in little parties of 4 or 5.
They evidently kept arriving for although we never saw
more than 4 or 5 at once the places of those killed
were quickly filled & the supply seemed inexhaustible.
  The woods here are very like those about Umbagog
but the spruces and balsams are less numerous, smaller,
and with the arbor vitae, chiefly confined to the
swamps.
  Barn & White-bellied Swallows were passing & repassing
through the clearing all day. Along the lake shore
were Spotted Sandpipers & one Solitary Sandpiper.
Saw a few Ducks skimming swiftly across the lake
too far off to be recognized. At day break a Loon
was calling.
