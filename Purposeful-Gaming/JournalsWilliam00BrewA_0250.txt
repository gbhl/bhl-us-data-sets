Oct. 1
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Cloudless and perfectly calm all day. Sun very hot and 
ther. probably above 70[degrees] at noon. A perfect day.
  Left Lakeside by steamer at 8 a.M. taking Jim and
Aldana Brooks. It was slightly foggy on the Lake and we
saw nothing but a few Loons, all young birds. On reaching
my  camping ground of last year found Charlie in charge
of the tents which had been pitched yesterday. All three
of the men went to work at once on a float for a landing
which they finished by noon. The afternoon was spent 
in cutting timber for the shed camp the walls of which
were raised before dark.

  I superintended the work and paid some attention,
also, to the small birds of which there were a great 
many such as Chickadees (both species) Knights (both species)
Hermit Thrushes, Yellow rump Warblers, Blue Jays, Canada 
Jays (two), Red-bellied [?] , and a Yellow-bellied
Woodpecker. In the distance I heard a Hylo[?][?][?]  and
there was a Kingfisher sounding his rattle on the Lake
shore. Red squirrels were chittering in the spruces and 
wood mice rustling in the wind falls. Towards evening 
the autumn call of Hyla pickeringii rose at intervals
from various parts of the woods. It was so still that 
the slightest sounds were easily heard at great distances.
The hammering of Woodpeckers, the splash of fishes, the
voices of men talking in ordinary tones on the marshes
at the [?]; every now and then the distant 
report of a gun.

  After night fall there were no sounds but fhe 
occasional cry of a Loon. The Great Horned Owls 
seem to have deserted this locality for even the
bright moon which rose at about 9 o'clock did not
