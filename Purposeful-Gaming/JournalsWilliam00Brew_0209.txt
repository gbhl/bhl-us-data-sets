1889
Feb. 1
Enterprise, Florida.
Clear and cool with N. wind.
  Off at 8.30 A. M. getting back by 3.30 P. M. Drive
about 18 miles, most of the way through open pine
woods, much of the time working the dogs (a black
Gordon and a black - & - white "field trial") from the
wagon. They ranged superbly and found
two bevies of Quail, pointing both. Cory shot two
from the first bevy but lost both in palmetto
scrub. I fired three shots and missed all of them.
From the second bevy I shot two and C. two.
I also shot a Snipe that rose from a wet
place in the palmetto scrub. As we drove
through the pines, following no path, we started
several P. aestivalis and large flocks of St[?]
m. mexicana. Bluebirds were numerous in the
trees and we saw a pair of Picus borealis
but very few other birds &, to my surprise, only
three or four Sitta pusilla.
  We next drove to Thom Hill Prairie, a large expanse
of marsh, partly flooded, partly dry or rather only
muddy. Here we began to beat for Snipe, of which
we started 14. Of these I killed eight (missing
only one bird) and C. four. They were well
scattered and lay like stones. At the first
report of our guns clouds of birds rose all
over the marsh. There were fully 200 Buzzards,
3 or 4 Ardea egretta, about 8 A. ludoviciana
and perhaps a dozen Killdeer. Besides these
there were some 25 Tachycineta bicolor and
a single Titlark. We also started a Bittern
and a Short-billed Marsh Wren. Meadow Larks
