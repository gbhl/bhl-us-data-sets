40[degrees]. Rose as usual,
& walked down to school.
Our hours have now been
changed so that we get
out no earlier than the last
hour. In P.M. had Tiger
harnessed & rode over
to the pine swamp.
Searched it but found
nothing. Then went to
my Nuthatch's nest &
just as it was getting dark cut it
open & left it for to-morrow.
In the evening rode down
to Cambridge & called on R. Deane.
Carpopdacuis Perpureus, heard
an old male singing this
morning. Gallinago Wilsonii
heard one just as it was getting
dark making his peculiar whir-
ring sound.

Ther. about 40[degrees] - 60[degrees] - 
38[degrees]. Rose as usual & walked
down with the boys.
Got out at the beginning of
the last hour & came directly
home. After eating lunch
& getting my Greek, went
to the Nuthatch's cut open
last night but although
the nest had been finished it
was empty. Thence down
to 'the pond' & rowed & sailed
all the rest of the P.M. Studied
in evening on my geometry
