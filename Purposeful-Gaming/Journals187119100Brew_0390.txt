1887
Oct. 22
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and cold with high N.W. wind. Yesterday 
was stormy, a wam S. E. rain with strong wind,
the sky clearing at sunset.
  Took the 6:30 A.M. train for Concord, meeting
Melvin at Waltham. He had made arrangements
for a day's shooting at Concord and on reaching
that station we found a team awaiting us. 
  Starting at once we drove directly to the "Parker lot"
(via Wetherbee's Mills). Our first beat was the stripe of 
birches just south of the "Parker lot". This proved a 
blank although M. left two Woodcock there on the 19th.
  We next tried the birches on the other (west) side of
the road but Buttrick and Warren were ahead of us. 
They flushed two Woodcock on the knoll before we
got to the spot and killed one of them.

almost immediately came to a point on the edge of a 
copse of alders still green with foliage. The bird, a fine
large Woodcock, was finally flushed and killed by one or
both of us, for we both fired at once. Don next pointed a 
Grouse which I shot at but missed having only a very 
poor chance. 
  From this [?] we crossed a meadow and penetrating 
through a large trail of woodland climbed a hill and 
descended on the other side to Braybrook's Birches, one
of our old-time grounds. Here we found and killed
four Woodcock "Don" making four staunch points on
them. The first I shot just as it was alighting, the 
second fell to the simultaneous shots of both our guns,
M. firing his other barrel also and missing, the third
M. shot at and missed and I flushed a second time 
and killed (this Bird flew about 200 yds. and dropped
