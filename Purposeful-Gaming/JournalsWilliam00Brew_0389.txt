1889
Oct. 5
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Cloudy with light N.E. to S.E. wind. Rather warm.
  At daybreak this morning heard a Pine Grosbeak whistling 
near the camp. A Canada Jay also came about and 
later in the day descended to the ground in front of the
tent and took a piece of bread which the cook threw
out to it.

  Off at 8 a.m. rowing into Leonard's Pond and then
carrying the boat across into the Megalloway. At the
landing, a Canada Jay was flitting about among
the stubs.

  Just above Pulpit Rock saw a very large Mink on
the bank. It galloped along leaping rather heavily &
making as much noise as a dog among the dry
leaves.

  Reaching Pine Hill Pond we entered it and
paddled nearly half a mile back among the
stubs for this water is now nearly as high as in
spring. At the extreme end of the meadow I
rapped the paddle on the side of the boat and
started eight or ten Black Ducks which had been 
feeding further back among the trees than we could
get with the boat. There was a Canada Jay among 
the stubs in this pond.

  Our next stop was at Bear Brook where the water 
was so high that we had to carry the boat over
the road instead of running under the bridge.
We ran up the brook nearly half-a-mile, Jim paddling
very slowly and silently. Near the spot where I shot
the Wood Ducks on my last visit, we started two Black  
Ducks at about 40 yds. They swung around us and I
fired both barrels killing with the second but missing
apparently with the first. Several hundred yards
