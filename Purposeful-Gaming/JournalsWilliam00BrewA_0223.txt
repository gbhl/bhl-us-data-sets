1890
Sept. 20;
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
  Early morning cloudy with light rain; clearing at 10 A.M. Re-
mainder of day clear and warm.
  In company with H.W. Henshaw I reached Bethel last night at
9 o'clock. At daybreak this morning heard a Phoebe in full song
in front of hotel. Started for the Lake at 8.45 A.M. in one of
Lane's wagons drawn by a pair of wretched, half starved horses.
  We reached Poplar Tavern at eleven and dined there. Mrs.
Bartlett had only a few new birds, a gray Screech Owl (Megascops
asio) shot at one of the lumber camps in the Notch last autumn,
the third she has had from the same locality, and a Sheldrake,
one of twenty five that have appeared in Bear River lately.

  At 1 P.M. started again and got to Lakeside a little after
sunset. Saw very few birds by the way, only Junco, a few Grass
Finches one or two small flocks of Cedar Birds, a few Chipping
Sparrows & Song Sparrows. No Robins and no Hawks. Three or
four Crows but no Jays.
