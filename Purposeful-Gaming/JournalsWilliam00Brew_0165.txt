1888
Oct. 9.
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Cloudy all day with high N. W. wind and
almost incessant snow squalls. At day-
light it was snowing steadily and
the ground and the trees were as white
as in winter. On northern exposures snow
lay all day to the depth of an inch or
more. The autumn foliage still at near-
ly its highest point of coloring was very
fine, frosted with the snow. Off at 8. A.
M. to the Outlet. Water very high and even
the high river banks under with only the
grass showing. A Herring Gull floating
near the bank. Tried to paddle within
shot when we started a flock of about 20
Black Ducks accompanied by four Wid-
geon. A fifth Widgeon started after the
others and I shot it a fine adult [male].
Next a Sheldrake passed near and I
shot both barrels at it. It fell out in the
Lake where we picked it up. Next to
Moose Point no birds there. Then into
Leongrad's Pond a flock of about 15 Black
Ducks in the grass behind the island.
Got within 60 yds. when one put up it's
head and they all flew. I shot both barrels
without effect. Next a Buffle Head came in
and alighted. We paddled within short
range and I killed it sitting. Hundreds
of Warblers, Sparrows, and Hermit Thrushes
along the shores also about 30 Rusty Black-
birds, six Bluebirds and a Phoebe. Next
out into river. Saw six Widgeon alight near
