SUMMER cruise 57 
A Wide belt of heavy field ice, which was dangerous to enter 
in the low fog that obscured the shores, lay along the land; con- 
Sequently the impressions of the northern part of the island 
were obtained from a distant view between the banks of fog. 
The Scenery was characteristic of the northern lands occupied 
by the Crystalline rocks, the principal feature being sharp 
rugged peaks upwards of 1,500 feet in height, rising above the 
deep glaciers of the valleys and backed by a continuous ice-cap 
a few miles inland. 
PONDS INLET. 
During the night much field-ice and many icebergs were 
passed as we steamed along the shores. Next morning at eleven 
o'clock, having rounded Cape Graham Moore, we came to an 
Eskimo encampment just inside Button point on the north side

mouth of a small stream, on the clay banks of which were 
located thirteen cotton and skin tents of these natives. All the 
able-bodied men were away in the whaleboats, either at Erik 
harbour, on the south side of the inlet, or some distance up it. 
There were a large number of women and children who, with a 
few sick men, completely filled a whaleboat in which they 
visited the ship in search of food. Many were sick with a 
disease resembling typhoid-pneumonia, being troubled by inter-

We secured the services of a very intelligent man as pilot to 
the place some miles up the inlet where the Scotch Whalers 
were anchored. From him we learned that the sloop Albert 
had wintered in Erik harbour, and that two small whales had 
been captured by natives in her boats during the early summer. 
Continuing our way up the inlet, a second encampment of six 
tents was passed about six miles beyond Button point. From 
the pilot we learned that the total native population about Ponds
