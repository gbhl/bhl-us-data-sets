GEOLOGY 209 
The specimens from the Laurentian area, which extends 
southward from Hayes sound to Cape Isabella, were collected 
at Capes Sabine and Herschel. The specimens from both locali- 
ties are very similar, the prevailing rock being a moderately 
coarse-grained granite, of a dark-red colour, composed largely 
of red feldspar and bluish quartz, with a small quantity of bio- 
tite in diminutive scales. These rocks are only slightly 
foliated in a few places. 
The specimens from the Laurentian measures beneath the 
Silurian limestones at Cuming creek show a greater variety. A 
red gneiss, varying in texture from fine to coarse, predominates. 
It is composed largely of feldspar, with quartz and considerable 
biotite. It cuts a lighter-coloured, more quartzose gneiss, and 
also bands of dark mica-diorite-gneiss.
