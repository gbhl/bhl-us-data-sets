1886
July 28
Concord, Massachusetts.
Clear and hot with light S.E. breeze; evening clear.
  Took a drive in the morning with Purdie
following the Leyington road to the schoolhouse, crossing
th[?] to the turnpike which we took back to town,
then visiting 'fairyland' and finally Sleepy Hollow country.
Heard four Indigo Birds singing and saw a Sharp-shinned
Hawk carrying what was probably a young Kingsbird in
its talons. In the [?] heard a Crossbill in the 
pines on the ridge.

  Returning to the house at noon we next took a
walk down the lane to the river and back [?] then
top of Ripley's Hill when I shot a pair of [?] Birds
[?] [?] of which was laying as I found on dissecting her.

  At 4 p.m. we started for Fairhaven Cliffs by river.
In the meadows above the french farm there were many
Bobolinks flitting from place to place in small flocks.
The Red-wings seem to be leaving; we saw perhaps 
a dozen in all. Swallows were also scarce, a few
Martins, one Bank, and perhaps a dozen Barn Swallows
being all that were seen. Yellow Warblers numerous
in the willows and button bushes along the river. The 
Henslow's Sparrow in the river meadow silent.

  At the Cliff's landing a Virginia Rail was walking 
a great outery in a thickett of [?] button bushes.
Presently she emerged followed by several tiny coal black
chicks which she boldly led out into the adjoining open
turfy pasture. Others remained behind, peeping. I shot
two of the young.

  From the Cliffs we hear a fine chorus of Hermit 
Thrushes, three males singing at the same time in
the oak barrens below to the eastward. With the
