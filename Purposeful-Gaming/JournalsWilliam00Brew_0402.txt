Oct. 19
A warm sunny day with floating clouds and dense haze. Wind
S. to S.W. - moderate.
  Just after breakfast we discovered a flock a six Old Squaws 
in the Lake off B. Brook cove. Putting the grass on my
boat we started after them when Jim spied another 
flock of eight light-coloured birds within a few hundred
yards. We paddled out to them at once. Through my glass
I could see that they were Greebes and one was unmistakably
a Horned Greebe. The others looked no larger but appeared brown
in color. We were now within 30 yds. and concluding that they
were all Horned Greebes. I raised my head & began to talk
to Jim. Hitherto all the birds in the flock had been floating
idly on the calm water or pluming themselves. At once up
went seven long necks and to my surprise I recognized
their owners as Red-necked Greebes. It was too late for a
bunch shot as they scattered and began to swim. The
next instant they flew. I knocked over one with each
barrel getting both after several more shots in the water. They
made short dives and showed the whole head & neck as
they came to the surface.

  We next tried the Old Squaws but they were as wild as 
Black Ducks. Four of the six were fine old drakes.
Where they flew they joined a flock of about thirty Am.
Scoters which we had not hitherto seen. We finally paddled 
to the latter near Metallak's Id. & stopped seven with
four barrels (of my two guns) getting all after reshooting two
or three. Six of the seven were young birds. There was not a
black male in the whole flock. While picking them up
heard at least two Black-bellied Plover whistling. Went 
down the Tyler Cove after them but in vain. Landed
& visited the famous Tyler Spring. A solitary Dendroica
hypochrysea flitting about among the larches near it. Shot
