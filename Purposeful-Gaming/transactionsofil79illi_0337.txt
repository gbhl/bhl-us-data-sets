in other respects. The whole tone of the run has been raised 
and neatness has been enhanced. At the same time speed has 
not been lessened. 
After five years of operation the test has shown itself of very 
great value both to the student and to his instructor. 
It has fulfilled its object of affording a reasonable measure 
of the manipulative skill and judgment of the individual stu- 
dents and has been of use in describing these qualities to pros- 
pective employers. 
By far the greatest benefit, however, has come to the stu- 
dents themselves in arousing their interest in the planning of 
their work to secure effciency, and in bringing about through 
this planning a much more thorough review of the whole sub- 
ject matter of the course, than can be induced by any other 
method. 
The various systems and plans of operation are vigorously 
discussed by the contestants before their runs and methods 
that succeeded with one are quickly adopted by others. 
During the contests interested spectators gather on the 
side lines and discuss the chances of their "favorites" win- 
ning. 
The posting of the final scores with their clear demonstra- 
tion that speed without care and good judgment is a fruitless 
waste of endeavor, in an analytical laboratory, is very whole- 
some in its effects. 
The principle of efficiency runs is one that can be utilized in 
many laboratory courses not only in chemistry but in numer- 
ous other subjects, and it is possible that its application in a 
number of lines might offer the best kind of data for a rational 
basis of recommending men for positions. 
At any rate, it is commended to other teachers for trial.
