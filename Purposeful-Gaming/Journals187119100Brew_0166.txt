1886
Aug 11
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and very hot and sultry despite a strong S.W. breeze.
  Starting with 6 at 9 A.M. drove through the 
Estabrook road to Carlisle and home by way
of "50 Acre Meadow."
  Red-eyes were singing rather freely in the 
woods and I heard no less than four Wood Pines.
Then with a high Field Sparrow and Solitary
Vireo made up the sum total of [?].
  Near the Southern edge of the woods a 
Red-tailed Hawk passed over us, sailing in
circles at great height.
  We saw few birds along the roadside in
the open country and almost none in
the woods.
  Clethra past its prime. Golden rods and 
asters becoming daily more prominent. White
water lilies still numerous along the river
and pickled weed not quite out of 
bloom.
  Insect life now at its fullest. Cicadas flying
by day and innumerable grasshoppers and
crickets by night.
  I saw a female Red-eye feed her young in the 
nest which was at least 40 ft. above the ground
at the extremity of an oak branch.
