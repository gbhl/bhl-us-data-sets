the French place.
  In one piece of Oak Woodland I heard three
different Scarlet Tanagers singing at once. They
are certainly quite as numerous throughout this
region as they ever were. Indigo birds are not
numerous this year; I heard only two to-day.
  Bobalinks are decidedly more local than of yore
and taking the country as a whole, very much scarcer.
They have deserted whole tracts where they were once a-
bundant. I think they are learning to avoid mowing
lands, where the mowing-machine ?invariably destroys
every nest, and are resorting, to breed, to the wild
meadows. In some of these they are still very
numerous.
