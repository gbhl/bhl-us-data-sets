1886
Aug. 20
  Clear and cool with light S.E.breeze, the air
bracing, almost chilly, like late September.

  Spent the day down river with D.C. French,
taking my pistol but making us effort to get
birds and getting none.
  We paddled down proceeding leisurely but not
landing until we reached our destination, the
meadow opposite the old woods below Ball's Hill.
  Leaving the boat here we crossed the meadow
and ascended the hill where choosing a quiet
nook under an old pine we spent several hours
talking and watching the birds and beasts.
  The large mixed flock, rambling through the tree tops,
passed over us twice. Its numbers were reduced
nearly one half. It had not changed much in
other respects and I recognized most of the
species seen in it before besides a Black-billed Cuckoo,
a Tanager, and a Hummingbird. It included today 
two Sitta Canadensis.
  Started on the return late in the afternoon
landing once or twice in Great Meadow. At the
long straight reach I flushed the Woodcock seen
there on the 16th  He crossed the river twice and I
put him up three times in all firing one shot
at him with my pistol.
  The sunset was clear and peaceful, the air
still and filled with a soft haze. Birds flying
about in all directions; swarms of Swifts, more 
Swallows than I have seen for sometime, several
Red-tailed Hawks, a Great Blue Heron and many
small flocks of Balckbirds (Agelaius). The only
