a [female] from her nest which was within 30 yds. of the boat &
less than ten yards of the spot where I found a nest
with young last year. Doubtless it was the same bird.
This nest was in a very open situation & was in no way concealed.
It held five eggs.
  After this we beat the high bank ridge up to the 
oak island without finding a nest but on the return
I stumbled on two on the inner side of the ridge,
one a little way out in the meadow (but still on dry
ground) among short fine grass, the other on the edge
of the ridge among royal ferns. The [female] of the latter rose
within two feet of me.
  All the time we were on This meadow a Bittern
was jumping at frequent intervals. We saw few
Swallows or Swifts. There were several pairs of Orioles
& we found two nests in the river maples. Yellow 
Warblers more numerous than last year. A single 
Spotted Sandpiper. Several Flickers.
  At the Manse Virio flavifrons (no V. gilvus heard there)
Empidonax minimus, Tyrannus carolinensis, Sialia sialis, 
[?] migratoria and Melospoia melodia. The Phebees
and Cat-birds apparently missing. Upon looking at 
the apple tree where the Red-start's nest was last
season i was surprised to see a new nest in the 
same fork of the same branch. I was still more 
surprised on starting the bird off to find that it
was not a Redstart but, on the contrary, a Least
Flycatcher. The nest looked rather weather worn.  & was 
perhaps the old Redstart's nest made over.
Red wings rather scarcer than last year along the
river. Houstonia and white violets in perfect masses
in places on the meadows.
