flushed two or three of them singly and fired
two more shots in vain. They acted strangely,
whistling almost as soon as they alighted, running
on before the dog, and rising nearly out of range.
  It had now begun to rain like a shower and 
we returned to the house, starting for Boston
immediately after lunch.
  Thus ended a delightful but curious experience;
three days spent in a small area turning with 
game, yet practically without bringing a high
bird or animal to bag. I felt well paid for the 
journey, however.
  In the swamps of the park I saw for the first
time in Mass. the inkberry (I glabea). It was 
abundant and presented an attractive appearance
with its rich green foliage and shiny black berries.
  In addition to the birds already mentioned
I noted Horned Larks (abundant on the Sand-hills
and marshes), Snow Buntings (a very few flying about
with the Horned Larks), Long Sparrows (several in the 
swamps) and a single Buteo lineatus lurking about 
the dove-cotes.
  In the bay behind the house were Gulls
and two or three Old Squaws.
  Off the extreme and of the point seem
outlying rocks were literally covered with seals
which C. does not allow to be disturbed.
