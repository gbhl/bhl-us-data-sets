WATER SUPPLY CONTROL AT EVANSTON, ILL. 
W. LEE LEWIS, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY 
Whenever a village emerges as a city, it inherits three large 
sanitary problems, milk supply, water supply and sewage dis- 
posal. The difficulty encountered in the solution of these 
problems depends upon the size and location of the city. In 
general, it may be said that as a population thickens through- 
out a country, these problems became more difficult of solu- 
tion. Their importance to the health of the community is no 
longer underestimated. It used to be accepted that sickness 
was more or less of a visitation, to be awaited and endured with 
patience and fortitude. With the germ theory of disease, and 
the modern science of Public Health, contagious diseases have 
been brought to the correct responsibility. This new attitude 
finds expression in such a statement that "whenever a death oc- 
curs from typhoid, someone ought to be hung." When you con- 
sider that typhoid bacilli can live no where save in the human 
intestinal tract for any considerable period of time, the criminal 
aspects of the spread of this disease are more apparent. 
As a society, we have not yet solved our problem of milk 
supply, else why the annual toll of sickness and death in every 
city directly traceable to this source? The solution will prob- 
ably never come so long as milk delivery is in the hands of 
competition. Too much altruism is called for. Evanston's 
milk supply is far above the average and an ordinance soon to 
come before the City Council will make the control still more 
rigid. 
Our local sewage diSposal problem is an interesting com- 
mentary on "how not to do it." A great drainage canal defaces 
our outlying districts designed to carry sewage of this and 
nearby communities down to someone else. State, govern- 
mental and international complications point to the inadequacy 
of this measure as a permanent solution. Complications have 
moved faster than construction, and the prospects are that this 
dilution method of sewage disposal for this community will
