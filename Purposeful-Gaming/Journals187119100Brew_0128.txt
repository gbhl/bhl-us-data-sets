1886
July 18
Concord, Massachusetts
  Clear and rather cool with E. wind.
  In the forenoon drove Purdie to Sudbury to
see the big prairies. Our finds were so numerous
in the woods that we did not stop there.
But merely passed through and around them
returning by the farm road.
  Birds were singing nearly as well as
yesterday. We heard a short-billed Marsh Wren (the
first noted this year) in the great meadow in
Sudbury, two Houston's Sparrows in the same
locality, and no less than five Yellow wings in
sandy fields near the roadside. Manly all
the common birds that are still merging
at all were singing freely to-day.
