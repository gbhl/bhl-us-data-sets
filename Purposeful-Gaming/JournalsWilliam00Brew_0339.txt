W. Townsend to Ashby, Mass.
  West Townsend to Asby, Mass. Clear and warm.
In company with Mr. Walter Faxon I took the noon train
today for West Townsend which we reached about 2 o'-
clock P. M. Having two or three hours to wait be-
fore the stage started for Asbby, our final destina-
tion, we took a short walk outside the village,
crossing a pasture and entering a piece of hard
woods where we sat down to listen to the birds.
Hearing a Black Throated Blue Warbler singing, we
pushed on, and, descending a hill side, found
ourselves in a deep retired glen heavily shaded
by hemlocks and other trees, and with a
dense undergrowth of mountain laurel. In this
glen we found the Warbler and had several good
views of him. There was also a Wood Thrush
here, apparently a female bird with young. Leav-
ing this place, we next entered a grove of large
white pine on the slope of a dry hill. Here
a Solitary Vireo, and a Blackburnian Warbler were
seen. The Warbler was followed about by a
single young bird apparently just from the nest,
which it was feeding at intervals. On the out-
skirts of this wood, in a pasture, we saw
a warbling Vireo in a large chestnut tree, and
later, on our return to town, observed two others
in elms along the street. Just outside the town
a Pine Warbler was singing steadily in an isolated
grove of white pines. In the village itself
we saw a brood of young Black and White Creepers.
Chimney Sweeps were numerous, fly-
ing about the trees and houses.
