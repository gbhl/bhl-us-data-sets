I peeped over, the Black Ducks saw me
and flew but the Teal had joined
a bunch of six Wood Ducks and the
latter stayed. Lumen paddled me
down on them across open water a
fog hiding us and helping our
chances materially. I got about
five Ducks bunched and shot into
them at 30 yds. Stopped three and
cut down another as the survivors
rose. One of my birds afterwards
got up and off. Picked up two
Wood Ducks and a Teal. Swamp
Sparrows singing all over the
marsh in the twilight although the Evening was
very cold. I was fairly numbed
when we started for camp.
