in a little cove close in shore. We followed the path
of the sun and paddled to within 35 yds. of them.
  I got five close together and shot at them to my surprise
getting only one but cutting down another with my 
second barrel. They flew only a little way and were
joined by two Buffle heads. They [?] very wild the
second time but I stopped one of the Buffle-heads
and secured it by another shot.

  While chasing these birds about we saw a
Phalarope which we followed for more than a mile.
It was very restless alighting for a moment and
then flitting on a hundred yds. ore more & pitching
down again. Melvin saw two of these birds. I
think they were Red Phalaropes. The one I saw
uttered a high sharp, short, shill whistle ([?]).

  We also saw two Horned Greebes & what I took
to be a Red-necked Greebe. The latter was very 
noisy calling [kr-r-uck?], [kr-ar-r-r?], [?] almost
like a Raven. (This cry is diagnostic & characteristic of Holboell's Greebe
as I learned by later [experience?].)

  Next to Moose Point a little after sunset a 
flock of 15 Black Ducks, a pair, and a flock
of seven small Ducks passed but all out of
range. There was a great quacking, croaking
plashing of Ducks in the North Bay
after it was too dark to see anything out
on the water. From the sound I judged a 
number of Black Ducks must have
alighted with a flock of Scoters in deep
water.
