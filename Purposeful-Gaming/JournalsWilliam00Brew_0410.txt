1889
Oct. 26
Cloudy all day clearing at sunset. Scarcely a breath of wind. Warmer.
 Before breakfast this morning a flock of about 25 Lesser
Redpolls came into the birches near camp and with three shots
I secured eight, two of them adult males. Also heard Pine Grosbeaks
& a flock of White-winged Crossbills in the distance.

  Started off in the boat at about 9 A. M. going through
Moll's Carry and thence up the Megalloway. As we passed
Moll's Rock a solitary Crow started from a stub & flew across
the Lake. Just after we had entered the river four Mergansers
flew through the Carry & out into the Lake.

  For the first two or three miles up the Megalloway we
saw nothing save four Mergansers, three in our flock, one
single bird. They kept flying on ahead of us in their
usual fashion.
  A little below Horse-shoe Pond saw a flock of about 20
White-winged Crossbills alight in some spruces on the left 
bank. Landed and shot two both very long shots as the
birds were perched on tall dead pines. The flock kept
dashing through the trees from place to place frequently
alighting but I could not get a sight at any of them in
the spruces.

  Landed at Pulpit Rock for lunch. Heard a Woodpecker tapping
in heavy spruce timber on the hillside & going to the place 
found a [female] Picoides arcticus which I shot at. She flew a
short distance & alighted then turned head down & hung by one
foot. I was about to take her off the tree when I heard another
Woodpecker tapping a few rods off. Looking I discovered a fine
[male] Picoides americanus working up the trunk of a large spruce,
& quickly shot him. I recognized him the first glance.
Afterwards shot a [male] P. arcticus near the Rock as we were
eating lunch. He came from across the river, calling
kloc, kloc as he flew, and alighted on a tall slender fir.
