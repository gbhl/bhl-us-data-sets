Sept. 29 
MAINE, (L. Umbagog.)
 Clear and warm; a dense fog lasting until about 11 a.m.
  Rose at daylight and after breakfasting broke camp and
started from the Oxford Club. The pond, so sunny and beautiful
yesterday, was shrouded in the damp, chill mist and even
the woods on the ridge were as gloomy as if night were
falling. Everything was dripping wet of course and our
walk across to the river was decidedly disagreeable. Nevertheless
it was not unattractive for the woods if gloomy were impression.
and the damp air was sweet with the smell of ripe leaves
and resinous exhalations from the spruces and balsams.

  At the Club camp we intercepted the buckboard and I
rode on it to Sunday Cove.  Three dogs that follow it
daily, ranging the woods for game by the way, started &
"tried" several grouse near the road. I tried to shoot one but
failed to see it before it flew &[and] then had no chance.

  The steamer, delayed by the fog, kept us waiting over an
hour but finally appeared and we embarked at once. They had
brought over boat according to agreement and off the entrance
to Sunday Cove we left them and paddled for the west
shore. On the way I discovered ahead a long-necked whitish
bird which looked at first like a Horned Grebe. On getting
nearer we found it to be a Red Pharlrope. It was swimming
briskly about bobbing its head quickly at each foot stroke
and sifting the water through its bill at least seeming
to do this. It paid no attention whatever to our approach and
after watching it awhile I killed it with a light charger
getting a beautiful specimen. A little further on I picked
up a Chrysomitris tristis that was floating dead on the water. It
was still rigid and I suspect it lost its way in the fog
early this morning & flew about until exhausted.

  As we reached the shore and were passing a rocky point
I saw a small flock of Shildrake approaching. Keeping
