1890
March 19
Cloudy with high S. wind. Heavy showers about
sunset.
  Yesterday morning at 8 a.m. I started down
the Suwanee River but the steamer in turning
around struck her paddle wheel against a
snag and tore about one-third of the "buckets"
out. The captain ran her ashore a little below
the landing and the reminder of the day was
spent in repairing the damage. I worked
on my [anos?]. Saw a few common birds
on the shore.
  This morning at daybreak we made another
start. The day was cloudy and windy & there
were almost no alligators seen. The river
was broader than I had supposed and not
nearly as beautiful. The banks for the first
thirty miles were high and wooded with
a mixed growth. Birches (B. nigra) growing
along the water's edge in places with palmettos,
live oaks, water oaks, etc.
  Saw a good many birds. [?] were
exceedingly numerous; A dozen in sight at one
time. Hood Ducks almost equally common.
Many Black Vultures but few Turkey Buzzards.
Three species of Herons, A. wardi, caerulea and 
virescens the last not common. Kingfishers very
numerous.
  Found Chapman and party on their house-
boat a few miles below Ft. Fanning[?]. Soon
after the steamer left us the twilight fell
and the Barred Owls began to hoot in the
cypress swamps. We rowed down to Clay Bluffs
before dark.
