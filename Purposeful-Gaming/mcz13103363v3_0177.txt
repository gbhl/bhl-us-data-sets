1867
Monday, December 9.
  Clear with a rather
strong wind and very
cold. Ther. about 4 degrees below,
6 degrees, zero degrees. Rose as usual
and walked down with
R. Deane and the Russells.
When I got home had some
lunch and at 3 P.M. started
skating. Got R. Deane & we
went up to the Glacialis
and stayed there till 5.30
P.M. The ice was very hard
and the skates made a singular
sound on coming on contact with
it. The entire middle of Fresh
pond was open. The moonlight
was very bright and the
air still. Went up to the
R's in the evening. Harry
Whitney was buried today.
