  At about 4 P.M. we went to the marshes at 
the Outlet which are now covered by about 3 ft.
of water only the tops of the [?] grasses and 
weeds showing. We found the tame Black Duck
exactly where I saw him this morning and
paddled to within long gunshot when he rose
and after flying about 500 yds. alighted near a
flock of sixteen other Black Ducks. The latter
flew off as we approached but we got within 
40 yds. of our single Duck before he rose although
we had absolutely no cover. I shot him this 
time as he sprang from the water. 
  Next paddled through Leonard's Pond where we
saw only a solitary Heron (A. herodias) to Moose Pt. 
where we started a small flock of Black Ducks
out of range. These returned to the marshes at the 
Outlet. As it was getting dark we saw these
Black Ducks alight and paddled to within 40 yds.
As they sprang I fired both barrels, getting a 
bird at the second shot and missing the
first. It is evident that Black Ducks cannot
see distinctly in the twilight for these were
in open water and our only cover was the
gathering darkness.

  Will Sargent went to Rapid River for the
day in the hope of getting a deer. He shot
only a Partridge but saw a single White winged
Scoter and a flock of six of the same, all in 
the North Bay.
