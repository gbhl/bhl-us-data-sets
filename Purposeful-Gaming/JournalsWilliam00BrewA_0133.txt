A hunt for Rails' nests in Fresh Pond Swamps
Morning clear. Afternoon alternately cloudy and clear with frequent
heavy showers and strong N. wind.
  To the swamps with Francis at 2 P.M. one object being to
find a Rails' nest or two if possible. Began the search by entering
the meadow N. of the Fitchburg and W. of Alewife Brook. The heavy rain
of yesterday had raised the water at least five inches and we
found it knee-deep everywhere and waist deep in the ditches.
In the first bit of meadow I started a Wood Duck from a pool
among cat-tails and found a Red-wing's nest with young. In
the big meadow beyond the first broad ditch Francis started a
Least Bittern in the extension bed of cat-tails where we heard
the Gallinule last year. He also found a set of five Swamp Sparrows
eggs. Several Carolina Rails calling but we could find no nests.
Crossed the Central R.R. and tried the meadow bordering Little River.
Several Rails here, also, I thought surely I had a nest when
one darted out of the top of a tussock directly under my nose
as I was parting the grass with my hand but the tussock
contained no sign of a nest. A few yards further on in the
top of another tussock I found a single egg of a Carolina Rail
an inch or more under water. Francis broke this egg and
found it perfectly fresh. 
  There were at least three Marsh Wrens (palustris) singing
in this meadow and I found a "cock" nest, very new and
fresh looking. There were none here last June.
  It now began raining heavily and we started back taking,
on our way, the meadow east of the brook. In a bed of
scattering cat-tails Francis found a Carolina Rail's next with fourteen
eggs, the nest in the top of a tussock within 100 yds. of the
spot where I took the set of thirteen eggs on the 23rd.
  We started two Virginia Rails in this meadow as well
as a Green Heron which flew from the bank of the brook
