SUMMER CRUISE 63 
high-water mark. In March the heavy swell broke up ice three 
feet thick, on which forty Eskimos were encamped. During 
their retreat to a place of safety three of these people perished 
from exposure or were drowned, while many more suffered from 
frost-bite and exposure. All the "survivors escaped with their 
lives only, losing all their belongings on the ice. 
The total returns from the two stations on Cumberland gulf 
comprise about three thousand sealskins, twenty tons seal oil, 
two walrus skins, one bearskin and a few white-fox skins. The 
value of the whole is less than the cost of the provisions con- 
sumed. 
A large amount of valuable information concerning the 
Eskimo living on the eastern part of Baffin island was obtained 
from the Rev. Mr. Peck. It has been used in the preparation 
of the article on the Eskimos. 
A number of interesting photographs, some of which are re-

a trip was made to the summit of the island. From that point 
the northwestern part of the gulf could be seen blocked with ice 
as far as and far beyond Kekerten. The brigantine had 
drifted westward with the ice and now lay becalmed in it, about 
twelve miles to the northward, with much ice between her and 
Blacklead. No special object could be gained by a trip to 
Kekerten, and we therefore started, outward bound, early on the 
afternoon of the 1st of September. Heavy ice was encountered 
all the way to Cape Haven, which was reached on the morning 
of the 3rd. The ship was stopped at the small islands about 
four miles from the station, owing to the danger of entering 
the harbour with so much heavy ice drifting about on the strong 
tides. A boat load of natives came off to the ship about an hour 
after our arrival, and reported that Captain Jackson had left 
with two boats about ten days before on his way to Blacklead in 
search of supplies, all the provisions at the station being ex-
