Along the roadsides the characteristic trees and shrubs were hickory, 
wild cherry (serotina), shad bush, tupelo, black alder, dwarf sumae (R.
copallina) hawthorn, smooth sumae, toothed viburnum (dentatum) white 
locust, bayberry, panicled cornel, elder and wild roses. No barberry 
bushes seen. Whitewood, polygola, wild roses and cornel in bloom.
  About the ponds there were the usual rank grasses and much blue flag.
  The road from W. Tisbury to Edgartown passes for miles (5 or 6 at least) 
through what are called the brush plains. The country is 
almost a dead level but nevertheless high in fact nearly the highest 
on the island being in fact an elevated central plateau. It is 
covered with an unbroken and very stiff scrub 2 to 4 ft. high 
composed chiefly of bear oak mixed with [?] a few 
stunted stragglers of the other oaks already named. In the few 
open places there are huckleberry, sweet fern, a true fern, and occasionally 
patches of bear berry. The tops of these oaks are all almost 
exactly on a level looking as if they had been carefully trimmed 
to form a shaggy lawn which in the sunlight glistens and 
shimmers as only oak foliage can. The winds that blow here so 
strong & constantly are probably the shears that keep this lawn 
in order but fires are said to run over the tract every few 
years and do their part, also. 
  The relative numbers of the different birds seen may be best 
given in the accompanying field list but I will add that: 
The characteristic common birds of the oak woods seemed to be 
Red-eyed Vireos, Parula Warblers, Oven-birds, Wood Pewees and Blue Jays. 
Of the farming lands and pastures, Robins, Chipping Sparrows, Thrashers, Grass Finches, Barn 
Swallows, Meadow Larks, Song Sparrows, Field Sparrows, Crows & King Birds.  
Of the swamps, Red wings, Maryland Yellow-throats, Cat-birds, 
Thrashers & Song Sparrows.
  Of the villages Blue birds, Yellow Warblers, Chimney Swift, Robins, 
Chippies & Purple Finches and English Sparrows.
  Thrashers & Towhees swarmed in the plains scrub & Prairie Warblers, Field 
Sparrows, and Yellow-throats were common.
