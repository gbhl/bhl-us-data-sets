Wind N. E., a storm threatening late in the day.

River from

Wayland.[/margin]
  With Chadbourne took 6.30 A. M. train for Concord.
Found my boat (which has not been used since June) all
safe and launching it started up the river. Found the
water nearly as high as in April and most of the
meadows flooded. A light N. E. wind ruffled the surface
and helped us on our way when we chose to use the
sail. Just above the town in the alders at the spring
by the Cattle Fair grounds we found a flock of six Rusty
Blackbirds with which was a young [male] Red-wing. Failed to
get a shot at them. Just above French's bend saw
a Buteo, probably B. lineatus. Opposite the Cliffs landed
& beat for Quail. On the edge of some oak scrub "Don"
found & pointed a bevy of about twelve. They rose
wild and the result of three barrels fired after them
was only one broken winged bird. Followed them into
the scrub, a perfect ta[?]gh with most of the oaks still
in full leaf. Fired a number of shots, most of them
over points, but got only one more bird. Flushed a
Grouse twice. Left the place at 2 P. M. & kept on up
river. Started a Heron (A. herodias) at the place where
we landed.

  Just beyond Martha's Point saw a Shrike, a very
brown one. It alighted in a thicket near the
bank & Chadbourne fired at it from the boat but
missed.

  Sailed from Fairhaven nearly to the bridge at the
head of Sudbury Meadows. The water was about
three feet deep over the marshes & disregarding the
river channel we steered a straight course most
