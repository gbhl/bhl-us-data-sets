fine adult male, sitting on a large smooth log on
the river bank just outside the woods. I paddled
quietly past him within fifteen yards and then
turning the canoe shot him.
  Continuing on I heard a Gray Plover (Squatosola)
whistling and thinking he might be in Ryerson's pond
turned in there. Two whistlers rose next the woods
and flew out towards the Lake. A Semipalmated Plover 
called in the distance and presently came to my
answering whistle passing the boat within a few
yards. A Marsh Hawk, a young bird, passed beating
the long grass along the river bank.

  I sailed most of way home from here seeing
nothing except a Spotted Sandpiper at the mouth
of the river.
  The water is just right for good shooting and
the marshes seem to be in fine condition for
Snipe. There is little mud to be seen about the
coves, however.

Sept. 7
Cloudy with light rain all day, clearing at sunset.
  At about 5 p.m. I took my Rusteton canoe and
paddled over to the Cambridge River marshes. Before
I left the wharf I heard Yellow-legs and upon reaching
the marsh found a flock of four T. flavipes with a
Tringa maculata. Shot two Yellow-legs & the Grass Bird with 
one barrel. The smoke hid the other two birds but after
making a long flight they returned and alighted again
& paddling up to them I killed one sitting & another
as it rose. The next moment a high Eruenetes pusilius
flew past & I shot it. Saw another T[ringa] maculata which
was very shy and restless.
