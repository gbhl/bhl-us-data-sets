PREFACE. 
In compiling the present list, the author has tried to be reasonably conserv- 
ative as regards the admission of species in doubtful standing. In order to be 
worthy of a place on the State List an "accidental" must have been as a rule 
Secured and preserved so that it can be re-identified whenever desirable. The 
more unusual and unexpected the alleged occurrence of a species, the better 
the evidence must be of such occurrence before it can be accepted as authentic. 
For the sake of convenience the sequence of the American Ornithologists' 
Union Check-List is followed. But the nomenclature has in several cases been 
remodeled according to the best of the author's own knowledge. It is held that 
actual geographical continuity in range accompanying corresponding intergrada- 
tion is the criterion for the application of trinomials. Hence nearly all insular 
and geographically isolated forms should be treated as Species. "Slight degree of 
difference" and "intergradation through individual variation" are criteria which 
can only lead to endless confusion. It would also seem advisable to use the bi- 
nomial in both cases until two forms are proven to be in geographical continuity. 
But this has not been undertaken here. "A binomial is preferable to a trinomial 
when there is any good excuse for its adoption" (Ridgway). 
The author is heartily opposed as a rule to the further subdivision of genera, 
or the raising of subgenera to full generic rank. It is believed that a multiplicity 
of genera obscures the expression of relationship at least as much as it elucidates. 
subgenera are serviceable in discriminating smaller groups, and, as it is not com- 
mon to use such names in combination with specific and subspecific ones, they do 
not encumber every-day nomenclature as if of specific rank. 
The first number preceding the accepted name of each species (in heavy- 
faced type) is the running number of this list. Each subspecies as well as 
Species is given a regular consecutive number; for example 97, 98, 99 and 100 for 
branta canadensis canadensis, B. c. hutchinsi, B. c. occidentalis and B. c. minima, not 
97, 97 a, 97 b and 97 c, as would be the numeration according to the A. O. U. 
Check-List system. For a subSpecies is believed to be just as "important" as a 
species. 
The second number (in parenthesis) is that of the same species on the A. O. 
U. Check-List. 
The "Synonyms" are all the other names besides the accepted one by which 
each species has been known in California literature; the synonyms, therefore, 
apply only to the species as occurring within this State. The Index contains 
both the accepted names and the synonyms, so that it should prove of service in 
the allocation of names used in the earlier published accounts of California birds. 
The "Status" is intended to give in a condensed sentence the range, compar- 
ative abundance and season of occurrence of the species in question. The range 
is usually expressed by Zones and Faunal Areas which are outlined in the accom- 
panying maps. This "Status," although drawn up with care, is intended chiefly
