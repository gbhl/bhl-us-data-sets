1867
Sunday, February 3.
  Cloudy all day with a
thick fog. Ther. averaged
about 40 [degrees] and the snow
settled wonderfully. Went
to church and Sabbath
school in A.M. being late
to the latter. The walking
was miserable. Read most
of the afternoon and
evening and wrote a compo.
(subject, the great snow storm)
to be handed in to-morrow.
Went to walk up Brattle St.
with father in P.M. Saw
a tree sparrow. The snow is
now about six inches deep
upon a level.

Monday, February 4.
  Clear. Ther. at 8 A.M. 34 [degrees], at
3 P.M. 40 [degrees], at 10 P.M. 36 [degrees].
Snow melted a great deal
and the walking was about
as bad as it possibly could
be. On the way home from
school saw ten cherry birds.
When I got home from
school found a chickadee
in one of my traps; put
him in a cage. Spent P.M.
in stuffing the shrike
shot Friday. Studied my
Caesar and Greek in the
evening, getting through
at 8.15. Read Picwick Papers
the rest of the evening.
Went to bed at 10 P.M. Handed
in my composition to-day.
