1886
June 9.
  Clear and hot.
  Spent the morning and part of the afternoon
also, on the Sudbury river going as far as Nine
Acre Corner bridge.
  I landed first at the ?Frenet farm where I searched
closely for Henshaw's Sparrows in the meadows where I
heard one singing last year, but they were either not
there to-day, or keeping close.
  On the meadows across the river and a little above
I landed again and after some search found a
Bobalink's nest with five eggs far advanced in
incubation.
  After leating lunch on a side hill covered with oak
scrub, among which Red-eyed Virios were particularly
numerous and noisy, I returned to my boat and
sailed home, as a thunder shower was apparently
fast coming up.
  I saw a Bittern flying up river in "broad day-
light", and heard a Green Heron.
  Red-wings are nearly silent now and I do not
see very many along the river. Saw the first white
pond lily.
