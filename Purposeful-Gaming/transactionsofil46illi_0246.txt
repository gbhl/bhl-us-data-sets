cost than abroad, it is probable that the world will demand 
exports from the United States at an increasing rate unless Fed- 
eral laws prevent it. Although this demand will doubtless be 
met chiefly by the eastern States, Illinois coal in small part may 
sometime reach the Gulf by a deep waterway. It is evident, 
however, that we shall have more important and rapidly increas- 
ing demands for the States which comprise the heart of the 
country, and which are destined to support an enormous popula- 
tion engaged in manufacture and commerce. 
Coal Fields of United States and of Illinois. 
The coal fields of the country as shown by the accompanying 
map (Plate III), include 310,296 square miles and contained 
originally about three trillion tons of all grades. The Eastern 
Interior Region, of which Illinois comprises about three-fourths, 
included about 70 per cent of the coal of the interior States when 
mining began. The Illinois field includes 35,600 square miles, 
and is the largest area of bituminous coal known to exist in any 
State. The original coal in Illinois has been estimated at 200 to 
240 billions of tons, though it will be many years before a close 
estimate can be made. 
Growth of Coal Production and Mining Wastes. 
Coal production in the United States is interesting because it 
affects the future in Illinois; and the inter-dependence of States 
unites us in the cause of conservation. Recorded commercial 
production began in the East in 1822 and amounted to 54,000 tons. 
The slow increase during early times and the enormous growth 
in recent years is pictured by Plate IV. This illustration is based 
on totals by decades, to the close of 1910. 
Illinois production began about 1835, with a total of 6,000 tons 
for the year. In 1907 it exceeded 51 million tons, and since then 
has fluctuated between 48 and 51 million tons, chiefly because of 
labor troubles. The accompanying illustration (Plate V) shows 
totals by decades and resembles the previous diagram for the 
United States. 
Total mining wastes have doubtless increased in manner similar 
to production; for it is estimated that for the country as a whole 
one-half ton of bituminous coal is wasted for each ton marketed. 
In Illinois it is probable that the waste is greater and approximates 
a full ton for each ton mined.
