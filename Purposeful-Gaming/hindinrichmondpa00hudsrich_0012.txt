viii PREFATORY NOTE 
Wholly indecipherable. I have therefore been obliged to 
divine, by the "suggestion of contiguity" to which Hudson 
so often refers, the place of each paragraph and sometimes 
that of separate significant sentences. My impression now 
is that the main argument runs clearly enough, for many 
of the little portions omitted had in them an intelligible 
line or two which showed that they did but contain addi- 
tional illustrative reasoning, not necessary matter. I need 
scarcely say that I have added not a word and have omitted 
nothing which could find a logical place.
