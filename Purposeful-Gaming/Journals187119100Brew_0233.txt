starting point where I found George waiting with 
the buggy. H. had crossed into some birches on
the west side of the road whence he finally
emerged after firing several shots in rapid
succession at Grouse of which he saw nine and
bagged one. As he had also seen small birds,
especially Thrushes, in great abundance we 
decided to return after going back to the Manse
for dinner.
  3 P.M. saw us again on the ground. Henshaw 
at once started after Grouse leaving me to attend
to the smaller fry.  I soon discovered the secret
of the abundance of birds in their spot over a 
larger tupelo three covered with ripen fruit. On this 
Robins, Cedar Birds and Oliver-backed Thrushes
were feeding most greedily and the foliage was
at times full of there while many were 
constantly coming and going. I shot ten Thrushes
in the course of an hour and might have killed 
many more but desisted when I became
satisfied that all were T. swainsonii. H., however,
killed a fine T. aliciai during his unsuccessful
search for Grouse. The Grouse were apparently
attracted by the wild apples which covered the
groused and an which they had evidently been feeding.
  As the sun was sinking in the west we
started homeward along the lonely road, very
quiet and beautiful in the hush and soft evening
light. Sparrows and Juncos were scratching and 
rustling among the leaves; a silent Thrush occasionally 
flitted across the path; Jays screamed among the 
pines. We reached the open country and last I met
the buggy coming for us. Thurs ended a red-letter day.
