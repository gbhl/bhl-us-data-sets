June 16   
came suddenly on a Wood Duck which rose with
a great splash and flutter, I was nearly sure
that it was an adult [female] a few birds further on
two adult [male]s rose together from the lily pads
within 20 yds. giving me a fine view of their
brilliant plumage.
  Marsh Wrens chattering and rattling all through this
meadow despite the wind and often cloudy sky.
Several more Kingfisher objects of suspicion and
persecution at the hands of the Black birds, who pursued
them wherever they flew, precisely as they pursue Hawks
& crows.
  Reached the lower Wayland bridge a little before
sunset and ran into the reeds at the same spot as
during my last visit hoping to repeat that interesting
experience. Alas! the high wind and gloomy sky
seemed to have silenced everything for there were
almost no birds singing or calling except an
occasional Red-wing, I did not hear a single
Rail here and only one or two Marsh Wrens. In the
big meadow below I heard our  Virginia Rail.
  Concealed my canoe in the grass first beyond
the last bridge and made my way to the 
hotel which proved crowded with people so
that I could obtain only a sofa in the
parlor for the night.
  Heard only three Bitterns this afternoon, two in
the great meadows, one on [?] Brook, none
in the middle meadow.
