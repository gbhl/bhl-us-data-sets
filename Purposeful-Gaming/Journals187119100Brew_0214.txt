1886
Sept.19
Concord,  Massachusetts.
Cloudy and cool. Wind blowing a gale all day from S.W.
  Late in the afternoon I paddled up river to
Fairhaven, sailing most of the way back after dark.
  Saw very few birds, a Kingfisher or two and at
Fairhaven a flock of five Blackbirds, another of two,
and a single bird, all, I think, Red-wings.

  Clear and cold with raging N.W. wind lasting
all day but dying at sunset.

at sunset[/margin]
  Late in the afternoon I paddled up the 
Assabet to Birds-nest Island opposite which I 
landed and searched the birches for Grackles but
failed to find them. The swamp fairly alive
with D. striata which were scattered about everywhere.
feeding on the green Aphidae. I heard a single
Water Thrush, I saw two Song Sparrows and a few
Robins going to roost.  Also flushed a Grouse.
On the way up river saw to Phoebes, and two
Kingfishes; on the way down heard a Green
Heron distinctly, twice.
  The birches have shed most of time permanently
opened leaves and only a few maples have
begun to turn. Kindred the woods are greener 
than in the latter part of last month but the 
foliage looks thin and worn.  There are few 
autumn flowers this year even golden rod and
asters being scarce and poor.
  For the past two weeks I have seen few
birds about the Manse; an occasional little party of 
D. striata, a Song Sparrow or two, and our steadfast
White-bellied Nuthatch being about all.
