ARCTIC ISLANDS 121 
and on the east by Prince regent inlet, Fury and Hecla strait 
and Fox channel. As Archaean crystalline rocks occupy the 
greater part of the island, the Silurian limestones being almost 
confined to the western side, the coast is very irregular, and is 
indented by deep bays, especially along the east and north sides. 
The larger ones on the eastern side, passing northward, are 
frobisher bay, Cumberland gulf, Exeter sound, Home bay, 
Clyde river, Scott inlet, and Ponds inlet, together with many 
more of considerable size and length. The principal indenta- 
tions of the northern coast are the long narrow bays named 
Navy Board and Admiralty inlets. Much of the western coast 
is at present unexplored, but enough is known of it to say that 
no very long bays are to be found there. 
Islands are very numerous along those parts of the coast 
formed of the crystalline rocks, and these vary greatly in 
size. 
The coast between Ponds inlet and Cape Dier to the north- 
ward of Cumberland gulf has never been properly surveyed, 
and the present charts of this part are, according to the whaling 
captains, quite erroneous. 
The eastern coast of Baffin island is generally high and rocky. 
The land rises quickly from the sea, often in abrupt cliffs, to 
elevations of a thousand feet or more, after which the upward 
slope is more gentle as the land rises towards the interior table- 
land. The general elevation of the tableland, to the south of 
Cumberland gulf, ranges from 2,000 to 3,000 feet, while to the 
northward this wide coastal area is much higher, reaching a 
general elevation of 5,000 feet, with hills rising above that 
perhaps one or two thousand feet higher. Inland to the south 
of Ponds inlet the general elevation does not appear to exceed 
3,000 feet, and to the westward is considerably lower. The 
land fronting on Lancaster sound, between Navy Board and 
Admiralty inlets, is very rough and broken, and rises in the 
interior to perhaps a general elevation of 2,000 feet. The
