APPENDIX IV. 
notes ON THE FOSSIL CORALS COLLECTED BY MR. A. P. Low AT BEECHEY 
ISLAND, SOUTHAMPTON ISLAND AND CAPE CHIDLEY, IN 1904. 
(By Lawrence M. Lambe, f.g.s., f.r.s.c.) 
BEECHEY ISLAND, LANCASTER SOUND. 
Acervularia austini (Salter). 1852. Sutherland's voyage*, appendix, 
p. ccxxx, Strephodes? Austini, pl. 6, figs. 6, 6a. 
The type specimens of this species were obtained at Cornwallis, 
Beechey and griffiths islands. A number of corals in Mr. Low's col- 
lection, from Beechey island, appear to belong to this species, judging 
from Salter's description and figures and those of Houghton in the 
Journal of the Royal Dublin Society, vol. 1, 1856-57 (1858), p. 246, 
pl. x., figs. 2, 2a. 
In Mr. Low's specimens the inner structure is fairly well shown. 
The larger septa pass to the centre of the corallites where they are 
slightly twisted, and together with the arched, rather vesicular tabulae, 
form a definite central area that appears at the bottom of the cups 
as a more or less distinct boss. The septa (averaging from thirty to 
forty in number) bear arched carinae on their sides. The corallites 
are slightly larger than those of A. gracilis** (Billings), from Grand 
Manitoulin island, Lake Huron (Niagara group), otherwise the speci- 
mens could with equal propriety be referred to the Lake Huron spe- 
cies. The size of the corallites varies in A. austini from about 3 to 8 
mm. in diameter, in Mr. Low's specimens up to about 10 mm. across, 
but in A. gracilis the corallites seldom reach a diameter of 7 mm. If 
by a direct comparison it is found that Mr. Low's specimens are with- 
out doubt properly referable to A. austini, and if it can be shown that 
the size of the corallites cannot be relied on as a specific character, 
then a. gracilis may have to be regarded as identical with A. austini.
