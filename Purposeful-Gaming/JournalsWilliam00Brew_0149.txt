1888
Oct 2.
Lake Umbagog, Maine
Cloudy and cold. Lake calm during
A. M. In P. M. high N. W. wind and
heavy showers of rain with snow
squalls after dark. To Outler at 7:30
A. M. saw two Red Phalaropes alight
on the flooded meadow and found
them swimming about in a patch
of grass apparently picking something
off the stems. Killed both with one
shot. Then saw a Duck which I am
quite sure was a Ring-neck floating
within 100 yds. Paddled within about
60 yds. when it rose I shot both bar-
rels at it without effect. Thence to
Moose Point. Flock of 7 White-bellied
Swallows flying over the meadows
Thence to Whale Back Cove, nothing
there. Returning spied a Duck Hawk
sitting erect on a stub. Got within
100 yds. and was about to fire a
thread-wound when he flew. Thence
to marsh opposite Leonard's Pond. Six
Am. Wigeon feeding in a bunch of
grass. Shot one barrel into them
stopping three. One got off wounded
badly, missed it with my second
barrel with another it settled out
in the Lake. Paddled within long
range and hit it again as it rose
but it got off. Shot a Summer Yellow-leg
on a floating log. To Moose Point at
evening. Pouring rain. About 50 Black
