The natives of Cumberland gulf congregate about the whal- 
ing stations of Kekerten and Blacklead, where they are 
employed for a large part of the year by the Whalers. According 
to the Rev. Mr. Peck, who has now resided several years among 
them, the total population numbers about 380 souls. 
The natives living on the north side of Hudson strait are not 
numerous, and are split up into three tribes. The Sikosiling- 
miut live in the inland region of King Charles cape, at the 
eastern entrance to Fox channel. A number of families from 
this tribe crossed a few years ago to Nottingham island, and are 
living there now, having been visited in 1901, when they were 
found to be without firearms, and were killing deer by chasing 
them with dogs and shooting them with bow and arrow. 
The Akolingmiut tribe reside in the neighbourhood of Big 
island, in the central part of the north shore of Hudson strait. 
These are among the oldest known Eskimos and came in contact 
with the earliest white explorers of Hudson bay. Old writers 
mention their filthy habits, and the present generation appears 
to keep up the reputation of their ancestors, as being the most 
degraded of all the tribes. For a number of years the American 
Whalers had a station on the coast, at Spicer harbour, some 
miles to the Westward of Big island, but it has long been 
abandoned. At present the Scotch whaling steamer Active 
enters the bay annually, and on arriving at Big island takes 
on board the entire tribe, after which the ship proceeds to 
the whaling and walrus grounds of Fox channel and Roes wel- 
come, where the men are employed in the chase of these animals. 
A few years ago the firm to which the Active belongs established 
a station on the south side of Southampton, and imported a 
number of the Big island natives. These natives, being provided 
with modern rifles, soon killed off or frightened away the deer 
in the neighbourhood. The old inhabitants of the island
