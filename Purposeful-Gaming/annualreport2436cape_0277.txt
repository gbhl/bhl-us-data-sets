this season. It infested all these species but one very 
severely. As some of these plants grow in great abund- 
ance around or near most Cape bogs, they furnish a large 
source of infestation for them. As the insect does not 
infest reflowed bogs, however, its progress from the up- 
lands onto the bogs must be very slow. 
HARVESTING MACHINE 
By an agreement between the Massachusetts Agri- 
cultural Experiment Station and a committee of this as- 
sociation, I have given much time this season to the de- 
velopment of a cranberry harvester. Considerable pro- 
gress in this seems to have been made.
