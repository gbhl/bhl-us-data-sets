After eating lunch we started up river. Near the 
steamer landing I saw a beautiful Shrike, very
white indeed and evidently in unusually high
plumage. After shooting at it several times I 
finally secured it. A little way further on we
saw another a young, brown bird. There were 
some Bluebirds, also, among the stubs on this
intervale, and while we were chasing the Shrike
five Sheldrake started up river and then came
down past us.

  Above the steamer landing we saw nothing
save a pair of Sheldrake, two Black Duck and
a few Tree Sparrows. The river was very beautiful
and we had a fine sunset. Reached the Brown 
Farm before dark, indeed in time to hunt
a half mile or more of alders and spruces near 
the house for Woodcock of which we found no
signs.
