1889
Feb. 13
Enterprise, Florida.
Clear and cool with N. wind.
  Spent the day hunting Quail starting at
9 a.m. and taking the brace of setters. Put
them out first about two miles beyond
Orange City. After running a half mile or so
"Robin" found a bevy of about ten birdcs in
a broom grass field. I made a double as they
rose, C. getting a third bird. They went into
the pine woods well together and the black
dog quickly found them on the crest
of a knoll. One rose which C. killed, then four
or five at which I shot both barrels killing
with my first. C. also killed another. Shortly
after this "Robin" found a single bird which
I killed on his point.
  With the next bevy we had bad luck.
"Robin" flushed them from broom grass without
pointing. We marked five or six down but
could find only one which C. killed. After
a long search both dogs pointed the remainder
of the bevy. They rose all around us & flew
past our heads. I killed one but C. did
not fire at all. Following them C. killed
two and I shot at one at long range
wounding it badly but losing it.
  Late in the afternoon "Robin" found
a third bevy among tall weeds along a
wire fence on the edge of an orange grove.
They flew across me as they rose and
I killed right & left, C. firing only one
barrel. There were about twelve birds in this
