reach that condition. The nitrate was used at the rate of one 
hundred and fifty pounds per acre in these tests, and acid phos- 
phate at the rate of four hundred pounds per acre and high grade 
sulphate of potash at the rate of two hundred pounds were also 
added. The results of this treatment, as shown by the quantities 
of fruit obtained on these plots in the fall, as compared with those 
picked from measured areas immediately adjacent, seem to show 
that the fertilizer had stimulated the setting of the blossoms to a 
marked degree. The plots treated, however, comprised only four 
square rods each, and the results apparently obtained may well be 
considered as needing confirmation by more extensive tests. 
INSECTS 
You will recall that we had considerable trouble with the Army 
Worm last season and that it was freely predicted, at last year's 
meeting of this association, that we would not see much of that 
insect this year. Our expectations in this regard have been en- 
tirely fulfilled. 
Mr. Farley has talked to you about the gypsy moth. He told 
you that you ought to spray and spray early. I think any bog that 
can be reflowed will not have to be sprayed, and it seems probable 
that bogs with winter flowage will not need much spraying to con- 
trol this insect, unless the infestation on the uplands becomes far 
more severe than at present. Just now, this investigation is becom- 
ing more serious yearly, and eventually we may have to resort to 
extensive spraying to control this pest on bogs not provided with 
a water supply sufficient for reflowage. If spraying is necessary, 
I must heartily second Mr. Farley's advice to "spray early," while 
the worms are yet in their first stages. Most of the eggs usually 
hatch between May 5th and May 18th. Spraying, to be most ef- 
fective, should probably be done about May 15th, and should, if 
the infestation is very serious, be repeated a week later to kill the 
worms that hatch afterward. 
I can find the caterpillars of the False Arm Worm easily, in 
their very first stages, by sweeping the vines hard with an ordin- 
ary insect collector's net, and by making counts determine fairly 
accurately how serious the infestations are. These worms cling 
to the vines with much tenacity as well as those of the gypsy, so 
I think the seriousness of a gypsy infestation on a cranberry bog 
can be readily determined, while the caterpillars are in their early 
stages, by the use of such a net, and the advisability of spraying 
be thus ascertained. I found that, if I didn't get more than five 
or six small false army worms with fifty sweeps of the net, the in- 
festation was not usually serious enough to justify spraying. If 
fifty sweeps collected ten or fifteen worms, however, spraying was
