1890.
Sept. 30.
Lake Umbagog, Maine.                                                                                            
  A simply perfect day without a cloud; the wind S. W. to W. rather
strong but perfectly steady and wonderfully soft and free from the
slightest suspicion of chilliness. At midday the sun was rather
hot & the ther. must have risen to nearly 70. 
  Jim and Charley went up the Lake this morning to pitch the
tents and get the camp ready. I had intended to spend the day in
packing but seeing a large number of Sparrows in a patch of weeds
on the intervale in the front of the house I took my gun immediate - 
ly after breakfast, and went down to have a look at them. One
of the first that I started was a fine adult White'-'crowned Sparrow
which I shot in a brush pile but could not find. Soon after this
I saw several more White-crowns and shot a Lincoln's Finch. En - 
couraged by this I beat the weeds carefully many times in success - 
ion driving the Sparrows from them to the bushes along the fences
and by the lake shore where I could inspect them with comparative
ease. Identified positively seven Lincoln's Finches of which I
shot four and ten White-crowned Sparrows of which I killed one.
All but two of the White-crowns were young birds. One of them sang
a confused but very sweet warbling strain not unlike that of a
young Song Sparrow. I could have shot most of these young White-crown
Sparrows easily enough had I wished to do so but the old birds
were shy.
