spot and finally stopping to look around my eye caught
the flick of his wings just as he began to drum again. I 
saw the wings through this performance but not the bird
himself until after he stopped. Then I reach him out
sitting in a slouchy attitude yet rather erect, but not
with his head and neck stretched up. After about five
minutes of inaction he erected his body perfectly straight,
settled down on his abdomen and extended his wings
holding them motionless for a moment. Then he struck
the air three or four times in the usual manner, when,
supposing him to be engrossed in his performance, I moved
slightly and he instantly stopped and folded his
wings without finishing. After another pause of about
five minutes he drummed again. I saw him distinctly
through it all. His back was towards me each time.
The entire performance was as I described it in the "[?]
Sportsman" years ago. After it was over I moved slightly
intending to shoot the bird but he heard me and
at once flew.
