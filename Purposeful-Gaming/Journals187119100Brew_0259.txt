The larger opening on the south side discovered four
deer feeding well out from the trees. This opening
comprises about twenty acres over which are scattered
boulders and occasional isolated pines. By making
use of these as well as stealing part of the way through
the woods we approached the deer unseen and 
finally stopped withing about 100 yds. of the largest,
a fine old brick with larger cutters. He was feeding,
occasionally raising his head to look around. Another
and smaller brick was a little to the right and
beyond were two does. It was a pretty picture and I 
felt little inclination to disturb it but I had made
up my mind to shoot a deer so, taking a careful
steady aim at the buck's heart, I pressed the trigger
C. had prepared to fire also, wishing to make here,
and his rifle cracked almost with mine. The smoke
blinded me but C. saw the deer spring high into the 
air and pitch headlong. As he lay struggling C. fired
again. Meanwhile I came very near shooting at the 
other brick which stopped on the edge of the woods and 
which I imagined to be the one we had shot at, but
stepping out to get a better sight at him I discovered
our victim prostrate and kicking his legs about in every
direction. Scarcely had we started towards him,
however, than he struggled to his feet and made off
at a feeble trot, his "flag" lowered. We both shot at
him again but he played plunged into the bushes and 
disappeared. Pursuit in such a tangle was useless
and after following a few rods we gave it up.
  During this stalk a Pheasant was calling in the 
woods, its deep oogh-oogle sounding like the bark of a
hound. Saw several white hares to-day
