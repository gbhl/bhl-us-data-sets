Lake Umbagog, Maine
rose and flew across our bows when I shot down
five with the first barrel and three with the
second getting all but one of the total eight. Four
were killed outright.

  This practically ended the day's sport. We
tried the Old Squaws twice afterwards but they
were too shy to permit another approach.
Before we could get to the flock of Butter bills
which we found off Black Island the wind
rose and we had to go ashore. After wasting
an hour or more we crossed to Black Island
Cove but the Scoters had flown up the Lake.
We started some Sheldrake from under the 
lee of the island and two of them alighted
out in the Lake. I landed and by waving
a small bush covered with scarlet leaves [?]
them in within 20 yds. Rising to my feet
I started them and tried a double shot
but got only my first bird.

  We then went to the flooded meadows, 
at the Outlet. Saw only two Black Ducks which
rose out of range. None appeared to be flying
about at sunset.

  Bill Sargent went over the Carry to Middle Dam
and saw eleven Partridges of which he shot only
two. They were very wild flying before I
could get sight at them.

  This morning before we left camp a fine
adult Bald Eagle alighted on a tall pine
near camp and flew again just as I
was about to shoot at him with a rifle.
