as it was light enough to see. In flocks of
varying numbers up to several hundreds each, they
poured past in an almost uninterrupted stream.
There were many flocks of Widgeon, Shovellers & Pintail
among them but fully ninety per-cent were
Scaups. I think I saw not less than one 
hundred thousand in all. The Widgeon flew
high and I heard there musical whistle
repeatedly. I saw a single adult male duck
that was either a Canvas-back or a Red-head
probably the latter.
  Dozens of Terns, Yellow-legs and a few
Marbled Godwits flew past my stand to-day.
In the  evening twilight a large flock of
Black Skimmers passed within twenty yards.
I shot two Willet from a large flock and
also killed a single Lesser Yellow-legs.
  After the sun came out small birds began
to sing. I heard White-eyed Towhees, Maryland
Yellow-throats, a White-eyed Vireo etc.
  Cory spent the day on a bay a mile or
more beyond me. He saw thousands of birds
and shot away all his shells, some eighty odd,
shooting down about sixty five Ducks of which,
owing to the poorness of his dog and the tall
grass, he bagged only thirty-four. Towards evening
Ducks of various species poured past his stand
in a steady stream. He killed many Gadwall &
Widgeon & one Florida Black Duck. He also brought
in a very fine Ardea egretta which was shot
by Quartermain.
