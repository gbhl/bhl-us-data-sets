1886
May 28
  Clear with wind N.E. in the morning. W.all the 
afternoon. A fine day, pleasantly cool and bracing.
  I spent the forenoon on the river, paddled down to 
Ball's Hill and landing on the way at a piece of woods
which I have never explored before, just this side of 
the hill. Before landing I shot a solitary Landpiper
that was sitting on the margin of the river. In the 
woods I pursued a Canada Flycatcher vainly and shot
a  D. caerulescens, the only one seen here  this season.
  At Ball's Hill I found several Black polls, a Langer
and two or three Chestnut sided warblers singing, and
in the swamps behind the hill, another Canada Fly-
Catcher which I shot but could not find. Black-polls
were also singing at my first landing place, as well 
as in our orchard. So the emigration has not quite
ended as yet.
  On the way down river I started two Night Herons from 
the maples overhanging the water, and near Balls' HIll a 
[male] Wood Duck probably the same seen on the 24th.
I returned to "The Mausc" in the time for dinner.
  In the evening just before sunset covered up the assabet 
with C. Just above Egg Rock a pair of Wood Ducks pass 
us, crossing over the meadows and flying down stream.
  At dusk there was a fine chorus Wilson's Thrushes. Cat
Birds, Grosebeaks and oven birds in the woods bordering the 
river. I missed the wood Thrush however although I 
heard one there last week. This species is unaccountably
scarce here this season.
