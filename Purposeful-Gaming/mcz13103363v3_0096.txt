Saturday, June 29, 1867.
  Clear and a most beautiful
day with a good breeze.
Ther. about 70弉��80弉��72�.
Rose ony in time for breakfast.
After breakfast took my
horse and rode up to R[uth] Deane's
tyo get him to go to Stoneham but
he was sick abed; then rode
down to E[d] Dodge's but he
could not go. R. Dana came
up and spent the A.M.
with me. After he had
gone I read and studied
a little. After dinner I
went up back of Mt. Auburn
and watched an olive sided
flycatcher for some time.
Went up to the R[ussell]'s in the evening
for the last time. Felt miserably
during the whole day.

Sunday, June 30, 1867.
  Clear with a strong breeze
but very warm. Ther.  about
75弉��86弉��75�. Lay
in bed till 10 A.M. Then
rose and spent most of
the A.M. in reading. Felt
much better than I did
yesterday. Strawberries are
rather on the decline: black
hart cherries do. Roses all
in full bloom. Currants
beginning to ripen. Most of
our hay is in. All the swallows
gone from the yard except for 1 pair. Young wrens,
y[el]l[ow] warblers, gl. robins, chip[ping] sparrows
out of the nest. Young Warb[ling] vireos
crying in the nest. Wrote Dan 
in the P.M. and rode through
Belmont with father & mother.
