70 cruise OF THE NEPTUNE 
The ship had not been at anchor in the harbour for an hour, 
when the Arctic, with Major Moodie and Captain Bernier, came 
in. Major Moodie brought the welcome word of recall to the 
Neptune, and after procuring some articles of equipment from 
us left again that evening, being in a great hurry to reach Ful- 
lerton "before the harbour froze over. 
A heavy gale of southeast wind kept us in the harbour until 
the morning of the 4th, when we rounded Cape Chidley and 
turned south bound for home. A fine passage was made down 
the Labrador coast, and on the evening of the 7th we reached 
Chateau, where telegrams were sent announcing our safe 
arrival. The trip across the Gulf of St. Lawrence and along 
the coast of Nova Scotia was rough. We arrived in Halifax on 
the 12th, looking somewhat weather-beaten, as was only natural 
after nearly fifteen months' absence. 
I cannot close this narrative without expressing the deep 
feelings of gratitude I bear towards Captain Bartlett and the 
officers and crew of the Neptune, for their unfailing and cheer- 
ful attention to duty throughout the voyage, an attention which 
rendered my leadership both easy and enjoyable.
