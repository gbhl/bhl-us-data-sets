head as if a hornet had stung him and cried
out most piteously. On examnation we found
that two shot had penetrated his tongue, one 
his lip, while his breast was also blood stained.
However, he proved to be only slightly injured
but we ceased hunting at once and drove
directly home.
  We saw many Pine wood Finches to-day and the
usual number of common birds. In spite of the
weathers no birds were heard singing. We passed
two Buteo alleni and I shot at one from the wagon
wounding it badly but losing it,.
  In the open pine woods I saw a Warbler which
I am very sure was H. celata but just as I
was about to shoot it C. called out that "Robin"
had found a bevy of Quail (the second) so I
lost the chance to verify the identification.
  Mr. Cozzens called this afternon. He hunted
yesterday with store keeper here who owns a fairly
good position and together they bagged forty five
Quail.
  There are but few flowers in the woods. Among
them, the most conspicuous are the huckleberry, a
yellow flower, single, on a long leafless stem, and a
white star- shaped flower which grows in clusters on very
short stems among broad leaves, both flowers and leaves
pressed flat on the ground.
  Crickets and grasshoppers(?) were very noisy in
the orange groves this evening but I heard no hylas.
  Mr. Nixon brought in an alligator which measured
8 ft 2 inches in length.
