and fair and it took us less than one & one-half hours
to make the run across. We saw only one Petrel on the
way. As we passed through the tide rips we put out
a line for blue fish and caught five small ones.
  After getting into the harbor we landed on the beach above
? Katonia and I made another search for eggs of the Piping
Plover. The birds were very numerous but after spending
an hour or more searching for their nests I gave it
up in disgust concluding that they must have young
out although I saw none of the latter. Least Terns were
numerous along the beach and there were a good many
Spotted Sandpipers. There were also several pairs of Wilson's
Terms evidently breeding.
  Reached the town at P.M. In the evening heard
a Whippoorwill singing in the distance.
