Oct. 24
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Cloudless. Calm up to 9 a.m. After that a moderate S.E. wind
all day. Very cold last night, the meadows & shallow coves
frozen this morning.
  For the past three or four mornings a flock of White-winged 
Crossbills have regularly passed over our camp at about 7.30. They
came this morning & two leaving the others alighted in the
top of a spruce where I killed both at one shot (a [male] & [female]).

  Off in Jim's boat at 8 a.m. entering the Outlet and
leaving the river by Richardson's Carry near which three Hooded 
Mergansers shot past within fair shot but a tremendous speed.
I shot both barrels but failed to stop any of them. Two
Horned Greebes diving near the marsh in the Lake.

  Thence to Sunday Cove. as we neared it I discovered nine 
large birds swimming well out in deep water. They proved to 
be Red-Necked Greebes. We took the dazzling path of the
sun on the smooth water & paddled towards them. One left
the others and swam straight for us coming within 25
yds. when I shot it. The others scattered & dove not one
flying. They proved nearly as agile divers as Loons and
after chasing several of them we had to give it up.
While paddling up to the flock, I saw a trout that
must have weighed fully 8 pounds leap clear of the water
within 20 Yards of us. It came out broadside to us and
I distinctly saw its red spots and broad square tail.

  Landing at the carry walked up to it to the old 
Megalloway road and then followed the latter about half a mile.
Saw absolutely nothing but a Blue Jay and a small 
flock of Titmice. Although the morning was a rare one,
the air still & the sun warm, the woods seemed entirely
lifeless. Returned to the landing & took a nap in the
sun. Jim, who had been to Smooth Ledge & back without
seeing anything, returned & we lunched. A Song Sparrow
