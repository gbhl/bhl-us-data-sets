LAKE UMBAGOG, MAINE
1886
tervals in a snarling tone almost like a cat. Saw it
perched on top of a stub across the river. It looked
as large as a Bubu. It was calling at 11 o'clock P.M. and
near daybreak the next morning. (I now know it was a 
Bubo virginianus--1889).

October 24. Sunday. Clear with a chilling east wind.
Spent the day in the house. Saw a flock of about a dozen
small waders (probably T. bonapartii) circling over the
marshes. Gerrish saw a flock of about seventy-five Snow
Buntings. In the evening paddled down river in search of 
the Owl, but failed to either see or hear him.

October 25. Cloudy with occasional light showers. Lake
calm nearly all day.
Started at about ten o'Ã§lock in the forenoon
and spent the day on the Lake, going up to the head of Great
Cove. A single Duck off Great Island. It proved to be a 
wing-broken Cook (Oe.americana). After a long chase and
several snap shots we finally captured it. Lunched on the
west side of the Cove. I followed a path through to the 
Thurston's clearing where I shot a Blue Jay.

Afternoon spent at the head of the Cover.
Started nine Sheldrake and twelve Black ducks, but fired only
one long shot at a Sheldrake. Saw a single Great Blue Heron. 
October 26. Drover to Bethel in the afternoon and returned
to Cambridge the next day.
