Migratory Thrush
[margin]Nov. 9,1865[/margin]
  Saw two and heard them 
plainly. they were flying
together at about dusk
and were probably the
last of the season.
(I heard one quite plainly Nov. 18th)
  Blue Bird
[margin]Nov. 4,1865[/margin]
 Heard one plainly but in
order to be sure I imitated
its note and it answered
me several times. It was
I suppose migrating and
is by at least two weeks
the last one that I have
heard.
  American Brown Creeper
[margin]Nov. 8,1865[/margin]
  they are now very numerous
being almost invariably
found in every flock of
Chickadees that comes
along. About 7 O'clock in
the morning as I was
watching a brown creeper
ascend one of our linden
trees it uttered several
times when it had got
about ten feet high a 
low sweet warbling song. 
I was directly under it;
no other birds were near, 
and I am perfectly certain
