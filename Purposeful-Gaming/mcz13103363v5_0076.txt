  Clear & pleasant.
Ther. about 60[degrees] - 65[degrees] - 
40[degrees]. Rose as usual.
Spent the whole day in
stuffing up the birds
shot yesterday. Mounted
them all with the exception
of one D. Canadensis, &
the D. Virens, which I
made skins of. In the
P.M. J. Nichols called
& stayed about an hour.
Father is getting better slowly.
Today we moved him into
mothers room. He has
completely recovered his reason
but does not seem to be get-
ting very much stronger.
Got two eggs from a Swallows
nest, in one of my boxes,
which contained four.
The lilacs are some of them
bloomed out & the trees
generally are covered with leaves.
