26 GENERATION OF INSECTS 
diate cause of the generation of insects was none other 
than the Omnipotent Hand of Him whose knowledge 
transcends all, that is, the great and good God, from 
whom all flying animals received their spirit directly, as 
Ennius thought, if we are to believe Varro, who wrote in 
the fourth book " De Lingua Latina " : " Ova parire solet 
genu' penneis condecoratum; Non animus, ut ait Ennius. 
Et post. Inde venit divinitu' pulleis insinuans se ipsa 
anima." Hereupon others add that it is no wonder Galen 
should confess so modestly in his book his inability to 
find this origin, and therefore prays all philosophers who 
may happen to fall in with it to let him know of it. 
But he, holding opinion contrary to the Platonists, was 
never able to believe that the Power and Wisdom which 
produces perfect animals, could be the same which 
stoops to form scorpions, flies, worms, and such like, 
called imperfect by the scholastics. What may be the 
truth among so many opinions or what comes nearest 
to it, I am unable to say, nor is it now in my power or 
intent to decide, but if it happens that I disclose my own 
belief on the subject, I do so with much hesitation, and 
fear, as I imagine that the lines sung by our divine poet 
sound in my ear: 
" Aye to that truth which has the face of falsehood 
A man should close his lips as far as may be. 
Because without his fault it causes shame." 
Although content to be corrected by any one wiser 
than myself, if I should make erroneous statements, I 
shall express my belief that the Earth, after having 
brought forth the first plants and animals at the begin- 
ning by order of the Supreme and Omnipotent Creator, 
has never since produced any kinds of plants or animals,
