Table 4 shows the amounts of feed consumed per pound of 
gain during each period and during the entire experiment. 
Table 5 shows the same results expressed in terms of total dry- 
substance per pound of gain. Table 6 shows the individual re- 
sults. (It should be noted that the values in Table 5 are not 
averages of the values in Table 6, but are obtained by dividing 
the total amount of dry substance consumed by each lot by the 
total gains made by the corresponding lot.) Referring to the 
data concerning the one-third, two-thirds and full-feed lots, it 
is found that in Period 1 the two-thirds-feed lot apparently 
was slightly more efficient than the full-feed lot. There does 
not seem to be much difference between the full-feed and one- 
. third-feed lots. In Period 2 there is an indication that the one- 
third-feed lot was slightly more efficient than the two-thirds 
and full-feed lots, which seem about equal. However, the in- 
dividual variations are so great that the results are not at all 
conclusive. In Period 3 there may be a slight indication that 
the efficienCy of the ration varied inversely with the amount. 
Again the individual differences are so great that no definite 
conclusion is justified. In Period 4 the full-feed ration appar- 
ently was more efficient than either of the other rations, al- 
though the individual results again were rather variable. Tak- 
ing the entire thirty-seven weeks of the experiment into consid- 
eration there seems to be no reason to conclude that the amount 
of feed consumed had any effect upon the efficiency of gains. 
As a matter of interest we have presented in Table 7 the co- 
efficients of digestibility of the dry substance of the rations 
during the different periods. 
INFLUENCE OF INTRODUCTION OF LINSEED MEAL 
A comparison of Periods 3 and 4 provides data for studying 
the influence upon the efficiency of the ration of substituting 
linseed meal for an equal weight of corn in the ration. A 
study of Table 4 shows that in case of the one-third-feed lot, 
about 15 per cent more feed was required to produce a pound 
of gain, when no nitrogenous concentrate was fed than when 
linseed meal was substituted for an equal amount of corn. In 
the two-thirds-feed lot 23 per cent more feed was required to 
produce a pound of gain in the corn period than in the corn 
and linseed meal period. In the full-feed lot 54 per cent more 
feed was required to produce a pound of gain when corn was
