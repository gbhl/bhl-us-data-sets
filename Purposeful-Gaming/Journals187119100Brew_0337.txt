1887
(Aug.13) 
still air again and again. Finally the bird ceased
calling & I walked continuously forward when a
pair of Doves suddenly shot away through the trees.
I looked for their nest in the pitch pines whenever
they flew but found nothing.
  A few rods further on I shot a Canada Warbler.
It was a young [female] in company with Titurica.
  Entering the big woods I stole through them
in every direction  Keeping a sharp lookout for Hawks.
For sometime I neither saw nor heard one but at
length the familiar squealing whistle came to my
ear and soon afterward a young [male] A. cooperi shot
past me out of range gliding close to the ground.
He alighted not far off and I advanced kept
flitting on ahead keeping just out of range &
finally disappeared. Later as I was standing still
among the trees he, or another [male], alighted near me
on the further side of a pine. I walked quickly
& silently to directly under the tree when he darted
out giving me a good shot and doubling up stone
dead at the report of the gun.
  There was a small mixed flock in the pines
among them another Canada Warbler which I shot
and the same family of Solitary Vireos seen on the
9th & 10th. The [male] Vireo sang superbly for a few minutes.
Creepers (Mniotilta) were the only other birds singing here.
  On the way up river I shot a Bank Swallow & a
Swift besides an Accipiter fuscus. The latter glided across
the river just opposite "the tent" and restlessly flew from
tree to tree once plunging headlong into a maple when
a number of Robins were sitting. I shot him finally
in the top of a leafy maple shooting for the spot when
he alighted without seeing him acutally.
