1888
Oct. 3
Lake Umbagog, Maine
Cloudy with high N. W. wind. A chilly,
dismal day. off at 7.30 first paddling
over the flooded meadows at the
Outlet., then rowing down the Andros-
coggin to Sweats Meadow. After attach-
ing a grass screen to the bows of the
boat we entered this meadow. Near
the further end we saw three Black
Ducks and paddled nearly within shot
of them when they suddenly rose. They
swung past within less than 40 yds.
but the grass screen prevented me
from either seeing them distinctly
or swinging my gun on them ea-
sily and I missed with both bar-
rels. Next entered Long (Mile) meadow.
Saw only one Duck there, a young [male]
Mallard which rose at about 60 yds.
from the long grass and which I
knocked over dead. We landed at
the mouth of a brook built a good
fire and lunched. Saw a pair of
Canada Jays at the entrance to Sweat's
Meadow. Back to the Lake at 3 P. M.
Paddled over the grounds about the Outlet
but saw nothing but four White-bellied
Swallows hovering over a patch of flood-
ed grass. In the morning we saw a
Barn Swallow, doubtless the same bird
seen last night at Moose Point. Reached
Moose Point at about 5 P. M. and con-
cealed the boat on the outer edge of the
