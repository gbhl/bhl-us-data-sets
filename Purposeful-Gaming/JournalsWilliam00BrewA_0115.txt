seen in this swamp while I think there were more
than the summer quota of Empidonax minimus
of which I noted seven or eight. In the meadow 
north of the Fitchburg I saw a Zonotrichia albicollis

about over Heron Pool I determined to investigate
the place. The water proved nearly over my long
wading boots but I got in far enough to find
