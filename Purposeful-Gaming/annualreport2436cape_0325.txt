The Green Span Worm 
(Cymatophora sulphurea Pack) 
This species also was unusually abundant this year. 
It wiped out what promised to be a fine crop on several 
acres in Duxbury. 
This insect lays from 103 to 117 eggs, while Epelis 
truncataria lays from 187 to 295, this probably explain- 
ing the greater prevalence of the latter. 
The green span-worm eggs are laid singly on the old 
fallen leaves under the vines and winter under the water 
(if the bog is flooded), hatching in the spring. 
The Girdler 
(Crambus hortuellus Hubner) 
We find that Black Leaf 40, used at the rate of one 
part to 400 parts of water with two pounds of soap to 50 
gallons added, kills the moths of this species readily. 
While this spray never can control the pest completely, 
it probably will help greatly where water for early fall 
reflowing is lacking. 
The Black-head Fireworm 
(Rhopobota vacciniana Pack.) 
The season's tests have shown that while one part 
of Black Leaf 40 to 800 parts of water with two pounds 
of soap to 50 gallons added is reasonably effective in kill- 
ing the worms, it is probably better economy all things 
considered, to use the insecticide at the rate of one part 
to 400 parts of water. It was found that one part to 800, 
with the soap, killed the moths satisfactorily. 
Spraying Practice 
We have concluded that winter-flowed bogs not re- 
flowed in June should be sprayed once regularly a few 
days before the vines blossom with the following mix- 
ture: 
Black leaf 40 1 gallon 
15
