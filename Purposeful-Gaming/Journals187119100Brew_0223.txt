heavy flight. Yesterday was nearly as warm as
to-day and very windy. I heard few Warblers lisping
last night and to-night (cloudy and raining) almost
none.

  Near the base of Ripley's Hill I shot two O. agilis
in the upper branches of a wild apple tree when they
were skipping about actively in company with
D. striata. One of them was uttering the peculiar
sharp call-note.

  I also heard an Oliver-backed Thrush in this 
hillside and afterwards shot at but missed it
in the swamp below. It was calling peenk.

  In the birches case of the swamp I shot a 
Scarlet Tanager and two Z. albicollis. I also flushed
four Grouse there, all larger strong-flying birds.

  On the edge of the alders bordering this second
brook I sat down to rest under a pine when
the ground was perfectly smooth and free from
rounds or brush. While here I "scrapped" a few times
hoping to call out something from the swamp.
The experiment was a success for I speedily heard 
a light rustling in the leaves below and the next
moment a fox appeared gliding swiftly but stealthy
towards me. He came to the edge of the thicket and 
then stopped, crouching, and turning his head from
side to side, but evidently not seeing me although I 
was not ten feet from him with literally nothing
between us. I screeped again very faintly and as he 
crouched still lower I could see the muscles of his legs
wok as he prepared to Spring but still his glance
shot at and by me without seeing me. At length he moved
a little to one side and getting my wind at once galloped
off. I do not think he saw me at all. He was about 2/3 grown,
plump and glossy, evidently not the box of Ripley's Swamp.
