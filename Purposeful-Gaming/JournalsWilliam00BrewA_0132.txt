Oak Island and Lynn Marshes, Mass.
waders. Of the latter we both heard one uttering a
short braying call which I did not recognise and
Faxon saw another, a large bird flying high and
whistling like a Plover he thought. Not a single Yellow-leg
on the marsh not even a Peep seen all day.

  We found our Sharp-tails, however, and in
abundance for we counted up at least twenty-three
different birds at the end of the day and doubtless
saw fully twenty-five in all. We shot ten, Faxon four and
I six. All of them, as well as all the we saw
sufficiently well to identify, were [suborigatus?]. There was
one shy bird which looked different from the others
and which may have been caudacutus but we did 
not get a very good view of him.

  My notes on our experience with these Sharp-tails are
so fully expressed elsewhere that I need enter nothing
further on the subject here. I lost our wounded
bird in a ditch and missed another bird. It was 
exciting sport chasing them about [delete]along[/delete] the winding
creeks.
  The marshes were very green and in places nearly
as smooth and perfect as a closely shaved lawn. Along
the ditches only was there any withered [sedge?] of last
year's growth.

  As we were waiting for the train at Oak Island
we saw three Herring Gulls, all gray birds, pass over
the sea. On the great marshes there were besides
the Sharp-tails a few Savanna Sparrows (singing), two
or three Crows, and occasional Swallows wandering
about.
