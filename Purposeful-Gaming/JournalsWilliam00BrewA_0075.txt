1890
March 31
Suwanee River, Florida.
Cloudless and warm. Wind N.E. to S.W.
  Spent the entire morning at work on birds.
After dinner we started out in our canoes.
Chapman went up Gopher Creek and brought
back a Yellow-crowned Heron & a fine [female symbol?] Wood
Duck. We heard a Turkey gobble just before he
started and he heard it again later but could
not come up to it.
  I crossed the river and entered a small
creek that came in from the west about a
mile below the Gopher. It was narrow, very crooked
and proved to be less than a mile in length rising
in an extensive saw-grass savanna. Soon after
entering it I heard a [?] a continued outcry
of loud, harsh voices which I did not recognize.
Rounding a bend I discovered the authors in some
Ward's Herons, young birds nearly big enough to fly
which were standing in their nests calling for food.
There were three nests, all in cypresses over the
creek. Three adult Herons were sitting among the
branches, one very near a nest the others above
the nests in the tops of the trees. The old birds
at once flew off upon discovering me and the
young squatted so closely in the nests that I
could not see any of them from below.
  A short distance above this I started two
Yellow-crowned Herons one very shy, the other
tame. Shot at the latter wounding it
badly but it flew out of sight among the
trees. I followed on after it until I came
to a place where my creek virtually came to
and end in a saw grass savanna or rather
