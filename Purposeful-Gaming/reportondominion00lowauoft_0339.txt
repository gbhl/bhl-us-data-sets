found in the lowlands east of Blaamanden, and at the head of 
stenkulfjord in baumann fjord. In addition to the lignite, 
masses of slaty clay were found in the latter place, in which 
were well preserved remains of Sequoia Langsdorfii, Taxodium 
distichum var. miocenum and some others, well known witnesses 
to a southern vegetation in these regions in a geologically late 
period, i.e., the Miocene.' 
The knowledge of the Tertiary deposits of the east side of 
Ellesmere is summarized as follows by Dawson : ' Small outly- 
ing areas of Tertiary (Miocene of Heer) are noted as occurring 
at Water-course bay, at the entrance of Lady Franklin sound, 
and in two places on the north shore of the sound. Coal is 
found in these beds in association with black shales and sand- 
stones, and from collections made by Capt. Fielden and Dr. 
Moss, Prof. Heer describes thirty species of plants closely allied 
to the Spitzbergen Tertiary flora, and indicating rather colder 
conditions than are expressed by the character of the Disko 
island Tertiary plants. The coal appears to be an excellent fuel, 
containing only 2 '01 per cent of water.' 
' Capt. Greely's expedition (1881 to 1884) though so impor- 
tant in its results from a geographical point of view, has added 
comparatively little to our geographical knowledge of Grinnell 
land and the northern coast of Greenland, a fact due to the 
absence of a geologist and the enforced abandonment of the 
specimens collected. From a careful perusal of Capt. Greely's 
narrative (' Three Years of Arctic Service, 1886 '), and from 
information obligingly supplied by him and by Lieut. Brainard, 
in answer to inquiries made by correspondence, some facts of 
importance are, however, brought out. The Tertiary coal-bear- 
ing formation is evidently much more widely spread in the part 
of Grinnell land, in the vicinity of Lady Franklin sound, than 
the previously quoted map of Messrs. Fielden and De rance 
would indicate, though it may probably be regarded as forming
