house for a check, the others being enclosed in cheese- 
cloth sacks and submerged for the Winter in three feet of 
water in a pond. 
The eggs of the check lots hatched almost perfectly. 
The dates on which the submerged lots were taken from 
the water and my estimates of the percentages of the 
eggs that hatched in each were as follows: lot 1, taken 
from water April 2, 25 % hatched; lot 2, taken from water 
April 18, 20% hatched; lot 3, taken from water April 23, 
18% hatched; lot 4, taken from water May 1, 25% 
hatched; lot 5, taken from water May 5, 20% hatched; 
lot 6, taken from water May 13, 20% hatched; lot 7, 
taken from water May 24, 5% hatched. The submer- 
gence in these tests did not appear to kill the eggs as 
effectively as it did in those reported last year. This 
may have been due to the unsasonable coldness of the 
early spring this season, which probably caused the water 
in the pond to warm up more slowly than usual. 
On May 29, 59 small gypsy moth caterpillars, rang- 
ing in length from one-eighth to five-sixteenths of an inch, 
were submerged on the leaves of an oak branch just as 
they were taken from the woods, in 8 inches of water in 
a wash tub. All but three of the worms clung to the 
branch and went down into the water with it. At the 
end of a 43 hour submergence, eight of the caterpillars 
were floating on the water, 4 had sunk to the bottom of 
the tub, and 47 still clung to the leaves. These worms 
were watched for two days, after the close of the test, 
but only one of the 59 showed any sign of life. 
On May 31, 50 caterpillars, from one-quarter to 
five sixteenths of an inch long, were submerged as before 
on the leaves of an oak branch, in nine inches of water. 
All these worms clung to the leaves tenaciously when 
submerged. After 22 hours in the water, two of the 
caterpillars floated on the surface, 3 had sunk to the bot- 
tom, and 45 still clung to the leaves. Within seven hours 
after they were taken from the water, 26 of these worms 
had nearly or entirely recovered.
