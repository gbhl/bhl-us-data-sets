Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Clear with dense smoky haze obscuring the mountains. Very warm.
  Left Boston with C. & E.R.S. last night by steamer to Portland. 
Started from Portland at 9 o'clock this morning and reached Bethel
at noon. Took stage for the Lake at 2 p.m. reaching Lakeside
at 8 p.m. The drive was hot and dusty until night fell when
the air became damp and chilly. The mountains were veiled
in a dense haze which spoiled all the more distant views.
Saw few birds during the drive. Three or four Cat birds feeding 
on elder berries by the roadside a few miles north of Bethel,
a few Sparrows at intervals, most of them S. socialis, a
Hawk flying from a tree by the road in the notch and
plunging directly into the woods (it was probably a B. pennsylvan-
icus) these were about all.

Sept. 3
Clear and warm, the air full of smoky haze. Lake calm all day.
  Spent the morning about the house. In the afternoon
rowed C. & E. up the lake nearly to the Tidswell place
landing on B. Point and following the indentations of the
shore rather closely. Eagles numerous, one fine white head. A 
Cooper's hawk sitting on the "Eagle Tree'. Saw the same bird 
(probably) this morning sitting on a post in front of the
house and afterwards beating over the fields. Heard a
Kingbird and two Barn Swallows. Saw two Peetweets &
heard an Osprey. Nuthatches whinny in the woods on the shore.
Chickadees & Warblers in several places associated in
the usual mixed flocks, none of which I investigated.
Blue Jays screaming at frequent intervals and Crows
cawing. No Ducks. The lake alive with boats mostly
pickerel fishermen, and guns firing all day in the
woods to the west of the house.
