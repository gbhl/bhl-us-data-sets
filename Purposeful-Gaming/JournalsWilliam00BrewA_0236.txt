1890. (Continued.)
Sept. 25.
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
  This place must have been alive with birds to-day to judge from
the signs and the behaviour of the dog who did nothing but point
every few steps. The evergreens were so dense however that we got
up only three Woodcock. I had one hard and one very east shot
- missing both birds. H. shot at one of them & also missed. On
the drive home in the twilight we overtook Charlie Brown who a
moment afterward turned into a cart path which leads to his house
and immediately shouted to us "Come and kill a Woodcock." I took
my gun and hurried to the spot where I found a large Woodcock sit-
ting on the edge of a mud puddle. I flushed it three times in
succession but owing to the dim light was unable to see it after
it left the ground. It returned to the puddle each time in less
than half a minute dropping on the edge of the water as lightly as
a big ball of thistle down. Once it strutted a few feet with tail
erect and spread like a fan. It would run before us for several
yards before taking wing, moving with a fine mincing gait. When
flying it made a peculiarly silvery musical whistle different, it 
seemed to me, from the sound of the wings by day but still evident-
ly made by the wings.

  Saw this afternoon a flock of six Flickers and an Osprey, the
latter flying high towards the south apparently migrating. Heard
Parus hudsonicus in the spruces where we found the Woodcock. A
native brought in two Greater Yellowlegs which he short early this
morning at the mouth of the Cambridge River.
