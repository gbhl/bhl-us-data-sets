the street near the top of the first hill and a
Melanerpes erythrocephalus on a stub in the burnt lands
  On the return drive we passed a pair of Tanagers
(P. erythronulas) which flitted along by the roadside alighting
on stumps.
  The foreman at the lumber camps tells me that both
red and white pines here average over 100 ft. tall. The tallest
trees attain a height of 150 ft. There are very many 125 ft.
There are a few white pines in his section that measure
21 ft. in circumference at the base. All the large trees
are sawed off at the base with a cross-cut saw, chopped in
a little on one side, then thrown by driving in wedges.
Logging is carried on the entire year, most easily and
profitably in summer. The logs are "yarded" by horses and
carried along on two wheeled trucks the wheels about 10 ft
high. From the yards they are usually carried to the
mills by railroads of very narrow gauge and light rails.
Many are also driven wherever there are suitable streams.
