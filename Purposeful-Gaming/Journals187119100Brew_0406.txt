flying from stub to stub chuckling hoarsely and once call-
ing cr-rais. A hairy Woodpecker tapping and calling in
the distance. No other birds seen or heard.

  Started up river at ten o'clock. Just above 
the first bayou or "logan" came upon a Grouse standing 
erect and still on the bank and shattered his head at close
range just as he was beginning to run. During the rest of 
the paddle up to the forks saw nothing more interesting than
three Sitta canadensis and a few Chickades and Juncos. 
Found Melvin waiting at the forks. He had shot nothing and 
had failed to find a Wood drake seen in the river yesterday
by Baker. Alva was off looking for Grouse and soon return-
ed with one. Lunched on the sunny edge of the woods at 
the forks, cooking two ducks. A pair of Parus hudsonicus 
came along and I shot one. After lunch Alva started off
again and I soon went in pursuit of a Hylotomus which was 
making a great racket in the swamp. Failed to get a shot 
but while listening heard a loud rustling and saw a mouse
bustling about in the dry leaves. Shot at it and was search-
ing in the leaves where it had been sitting, when another
and louder rustling attracted my attention. The sound ap-
proached steadily and presently a very large fine Grouse 
appeared, stalking gracefully through the bushes, nodding 
his head at each step. After watching him a few moments I 
shot him. Failed to find the mouse.
