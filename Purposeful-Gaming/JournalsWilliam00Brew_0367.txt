Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Cloudy threatening rain all day which finally came in
brisk showers late in the afternoon. Wind light all day
varying from S. to N.E.

  Did not go out at all in the morning but at
1.30 p.m. started for the lake House in my sailing
canoe. The wind served me as far as the end of
the large pond where I took in sail and paddled
the rest of the way. At the head of this pond
were seven Golden-eyes and a Great Blue Heron all
of which of course went out long before I got
within gun range, the Golden-eyes wings whistling
loudly in the still air, the first time I
remember to have heard them here. A moment
later five Black Ducks passed audibly. They came
from the direction of the mill. The rest of the
way I saw nothing save two Kingfishers.

  After spending an hour or two at the mill,
where I saw a single Bronzed Grackle sitting on
a stub, I started back. At the mouth
of Peaslie's brook I paused to look for the usual
Solitary Sandpiper and sure enough there he was
tilthing sedately on the mud. Presently I made out
another. As I was watching them, I heard a Bluebird 
and looking up saw a large, loose flock passing
overhead at a considerable height flying in a
south easterly direction. I counted 28. Near them
was a Sharp-shinned Hawk beating about apparently
neither noticing the Bluebirds nor causing them
alarm although he kept on for some distance
near them. Less than five minutes later I
came suddenly on another Hawk of this species, a
