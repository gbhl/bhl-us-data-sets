1886
Aug. 8
Concord, Massachusetts.
  A clear cool day with light S. W. breeze.
  In the morning took a drive C. to 
Weatherbee's Mills and back by way of the Parker Lot.
Long Sparrows and Red-eyes singing. Saw two
Lanagers in oaks by the roadside both either female or young.

  In the P. M. went to Fairhaven by river with C.
A clear, still afternoon, bird-life abundant along
the banks of the quiet river. In the meadows above
the French farm Bobolinks flying about in flocks,
one flock scattered along the edge of the river in the 
tall reeds and button bushes the setting [?] bringing
out the rich yellow of their breasts. A flock of 
Meadow Larks here also in a portion of the meadow
when the grass has been just cut. One of them old 
males singing as vigorously as in June.

  For nearly an hour, from just before sunset well
into the twilight, Swallows poured up the valley
of the river in astounding numbers, most of them 
passing low over the water occasionally dipping
down to drink. About 75 per.cent Barre Swallows, 
20 per. cent White-Bellies, the remainder Bank Swallows.
Thew were flying in a generally Southern direction
but I suspect were found for some distant wood
and not migrating. The flight ceased entirely
before dark.

  Just below Nine-Acre Corner bridge a pair
Wood Duck started from the marsh, a little above
three more rose from the river itself.

  We landed at Martha's point and spent an hour.
As it began to get dark a Wipponenwell struck up 
in the oak woods below the cliffs and sang vigorously
