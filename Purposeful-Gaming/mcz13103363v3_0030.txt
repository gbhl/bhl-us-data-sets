 Wrote our 1st Book, Latin Papu,
today; it was very hard.
I got out at 11.30 A.M.
 Walked up from the Grammer
School with C. Castes. Starting 
at about 1 P.M. rode up to 
Concord on my horse getting
there at about 3.15 P.M.
 Had a pretty hard time of
it getting home and reached
here at 5.40 P.M. Saw two
tree sparrows on the road 
and got very near some
crows. In the evening studied
about an hour.
