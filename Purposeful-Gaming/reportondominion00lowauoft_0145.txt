HISTORICAL SUMMARY 73 
this land the pinnace foundered with all on board, and his other 
consort, deserting, returned to England. 
Continuing westward alone, in a leaky ship with a sprung 
mast, high land was again seen on the 28th of July. Frobisher 
named this land Queen Elizabeths Foreland, but it was not 
until the 10th of August that a landing was effected. The fol- 
lowing day, in N. latitude 63, he entered the bay which bears 
his name, thus being the first to reach the great island of baffin. 
He sailed a considerable distance up the bay, believing the 
land on his right hand to be the coast of Asia, while that to 
the left was the continent of America. The land on the north 
side of the entrance to the bay he named the North Foreland, 
while Queen Elizabeths Foreland forms the southern point. 
While in the bay four of the crew landed without permission, 
and were never seen again; in revenge for their supposed 
murder by the Eskimos, one of the latter was seized and carried 
to England, where he died shortly after arriving. 
On his return to England, Frobisher was greatly commended 
for his voyage, especially for the hope he brought of a safe pas- 
sage to China, and the Queen named the lands bounding the 
supposed strait, Meta Incognita. 
A piece of ' black earth ' picked up on Hall island was sub- 
mitted to an alchemist, Baptista Angello, who 'by coaxing 
nature ' obtained some gold from it, or said he did. On the 
strength of this discovery, money was immediately raised for a 
second expedition, with the sole purpose of bringing back ore. 
Three ships were again sent out under Frobisher, and returned 
well laden with the supposed ore. During the stay of the expe- 
dition in Frobisher bay several skirmishes took place with the 
natives, a number of whom were killed. 
Fifteen ships were, fitted out in 1578 for the third voyage, to 
bring home ore. Carried southward by strong currents, the 
fleet entered what was later called Hudson strait, and sailed 
several days westward through it before the mistake was dis-
