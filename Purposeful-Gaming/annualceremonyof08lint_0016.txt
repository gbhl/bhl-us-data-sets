purposes. Their guardians were certain animals which 
were conceived of as having evil spirits. They were 
recruited from the lower classes in the tribe, and were 
feared and disliked by the better element. Like the 
medicine men, they were organized into a society, but 
nothing is known of their ceremonies. 
The Pawnee medicine men were organized into a 
number of societies which were united by certain 
secrets which they had in common. In addition to 
these secrets, which were known to all medicine men, 
but concealed from the rest of the tribe, each society 
and even each member had individual secrets. The 
oldest of these societies was that of the Pumpkin Vine 
village all of whose members were said to have origi- 
nally been medicine men. Its members derived their 
powers from a number of different guardians. In the 
other medicine societies, which were organized at a 
later date, all the members derived their powers from 
the same guardian. A man might become a medicine 
man as the result of a supernatural experience during 
which powers were conferred upon him directly by his 
guardian. Such experiences were sought through long 
continued prayer and fasting. More commonly, when 
a man desired to become a medicine man and had de- 
termined his guardian, he applied to some medicine 
man who had derived his powers from that being, and 
asked for instruction. If the medicine man believed 
him to be sincere and was willing to accept the gifts 
which he offered in payment, he received him as a pupil 
and, at the next meeting of the medicine lodge, took 
him into the lodge with him and instructed him. The 
lodge sometimes continued in session two months; and 
during this time, as part payment, the medicine man 
exercised the rights of a husband toward his pupil's 
wife. Often a medicine man would have several pupils 
whose wives would remain with him in his booth in 
the medicine lodge. He might instruct them also if he
