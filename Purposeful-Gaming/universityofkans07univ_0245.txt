HYDE, ETC.: REFLEXES MODIFIED BY ALCOHOL. 233 
or the reflex action to be lost or become irregular in its re- 
sponse within ten minutes. This change lasted from one to a 
half-hour after injecting the alcohol. Often 0.1 cc. of 15 per 
cent alcohol and 0.1 cc. of 30 per cent alcohol produced no dif- 
ference in the same frogs. The effect of the dose, it seems, 
depends largely upon the condition of the frog and the suscepti- 
bility of the special sensory spot tested. With doses beginning 
with 0.3 cc. of 15 per cent alcohol to about 0.3 cc. of 30 per cent 
alcohol, the turn-over, compensatory and equilibrium reflexes 
are not depressed, but the frog seems very irritable and rest- 
less, often failing to remove the stimulus in its attempts to 
jump out of the jar. With doses of 0.3 cc. of 30 per cent alco- 
hol the frog immediately gets sluggish and greater depression 
Of the reflex time is produced, not only in the skin reactions, 
but also in the higher reflexes; even spot c sometimes fails to 
react. Doses of 0.5 cc. Of 30 per cent alcohol cause a loss of 
all skin reflexes and of muscle tone. Frequently, following- 
such a dose the frog lies flat and is sluggish, has labored 
respiration, and the turn-over, equilibrium and other higher 
reflexes are lost for five minutes or more. Later, in some 
cases, the frog moves about restlessly and makes only weak 
attempts to remove the stimulus, or it may seem apparently 
lifeless and all skin reflexes abolished for about one hour. 
With larger doses of 0.6 cc. of 50 per cent alcohol, the turn- 
over and higher reflexes are lost within ten minutes and for 
one to two hours, but in twenty-four hours they are again 
normal, not, however, the skin reflexes. Doses of 0.8 cc. of 
95 per cent alcohol proved toxic. 
It was observed that when the spots fail to respond after a 
given dose they do so immediately, and the depression in- 
creases and is of longer duration with increase in dose, until 
with one Of 0.6 cc. of 50 per cent alcohol, when the skin and 
higher reflexes are all lost fOr from one to two hours and the 
skin reactions are not normal again even after twenty-four 
hours. Sometimes, following such a dose, respiration ceases 
and tetanic convulsions appear that last for about one hour. 
In connection with these experiments it was of interest to 
determine what some Of the doses of alcohol per gram animal 
would amount to for man. Sherry, orange and port wine con- 
tain from 15 per cent to 20 per cent alcohol, claret and white 
wine from 10 per cent to 14 per cent, beer from 4 per cent to
