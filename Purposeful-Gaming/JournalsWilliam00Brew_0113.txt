1888
Sept. 12.
Lake Umbagog, Maine.
Rained heavily all A.M. cleared late in P.M.
Spent the morning in the tent. A large black
hornet with white bands around abdomen, (the
paper nest maker I think) came into the tent
about once every 15 minutes caught a house fly,
bit off his wings and legs rolled his body
around many times until he had compress-
ed it into a small round bundle then flew
off holding it under his throat. The flies were
half torpid and yet the hornet missed many
before catching one. Fished the pool in the
early afternoon catching ten small trout.
Late in P.M. beat for Woodcock in the alders
just south of the Sluice, killed one, in the
brakes just north of camp another. Fired at the
first bird twice and put it up three times.
Killed the second at first rise, first barrel, "Don"
made firm points on both. Saw a Cat Bird in
the alders. In the opening a Sparrow Hawk
chasing two Flickers in play and uttering his
chattering cry. The ferns are turning brown,
the birches yellow, but asters still bloom in
masses along the river bank.
