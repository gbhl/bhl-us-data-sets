(June 17)
The ground. The [male] was in full song about 50 yds. away.
Another [male] was singing about 100 yds. off both yesterday
& this morning. D. found a newly finished by empty
Vireo's nest which may belong to this bird. It was about
5 ft. up at the extremity of a hemlock branch. In this
connection I should also say that we visited, early this
morning the nest of V. solitarius found June 12. It held
two eggs. [female] not seen to-day; [male] singing about 30 yds. away.
  At about 11 A. M. we decided to leave these woods & go to
those visited on the 15th. Striking across the swamp we
climbed a hillside beyond and traversed for a quarter-of-a-
mile or more a comparatively level, dry plateau covered with
dense woods of young white pines interspersed with occasional
spruces. Throughout these woods D. virens was everywhere
so abundant that two or three [males] were constantly in
hearing. We noted also one D. coronata & one D. blackburniae.
The former I followed for a long distance. It roved
straight on through the trees singing once or twice in each
& taking flights of 50 to 100 yds. At length I got a fair shot
but missed.
  Reaching our destination we first visited the nest found
by Bailey on the 15th. It was apparently finished - a remarkably
rapid piece  of work. There were no birds near it but I am
very sure it is the nest of D. virens. The Kinglets were soon
discovered by the song of the [male]. The [female] was with him & was
building but I failed to discover the nest although I think
I located the tree.
  In a cluster of hemlocks on the south side of the path a
D. caerulescens was in full song. I shot him & then looked
for the nest but failed to find it. There was absolutely no
yew near the spot only small hemlock shrubs & thickets
of raspberry. We reached the house about 4 P. M. & moved
our things to Winchendon in the evening hearing 3 Whippoorwills on the way.
