he aim of this book is twofold,-to give all necessary instruction on 
the cultivation of the bush-fruits, and to provide a cyclopedia of ref- 
erence to varieties, species, insects, and diseases. Every variety of the 
various fruits is fully described, this being the first effort to collect all 
information about varieties of all these fruits since the time of the Down- 
ings. In this respect, the book will always be a standard authority. The 
varieties are arranged alphabetically under various natural classes or groups, 
but a very full index refers instantly to any variety. The cultural directions 
are full and clear, and are entirely separated from the descriptions and tech- 
nical matter. Full instructions are given for the evaporating of berries. 
The author has himself had long experience in the growing of the fruits. 
The book is, therefore, both a manual of practice and a work of reference, 
and is supplied at the usual price of either one alone. 
The Principles of fruit-growing 
By L. H. BAILEY 
Professor of Horticulture in the Cornell University 
FOURTH edition-516 PAGES - 120 illustrations-$1.25 
here have been manuals and treatises on fruit-growing, but this vol- 
ume is the first consistent presentation of the underlying principles 
affecting the growth of the various fruits. It is thus unique, and it 
occupies a field of the greatest importance. It joins science and practice, 
for it not only discusses the reasons for certain operations, but presents the 
most approved methods, gathered from the successful fruit-growers of 
America. It appeals especially to the horticulturist who is willing to have 
his brain direct and supplement the work of his hands, and to acquire a 
knowledge of principles rather than a mere memorandum of their application. 
THE PRINCIPLES OF FRUIT-GROWING includes: Introductory Discussion, comprising 
an inventory and classification of fruits, the fruit zones, the outlook for fruit-grow- 
ing; the Location and its Climate, with a full discussion of frosts; the Tilling of 
Fruit Lands; the Fertilizing of Fruit Lands; the Planting of Orchards; Secondary 
care of Orchards; Diseases, Insects and Spraying; Picking and Packing and Storing 
Fruits, Shipping, etc.; and a bibliography of American writings on the subject. 
"The book is very practical in its treatment of the subject of fruit-growing 
after a brief introductory entering at once into the discussion of the location of the 
orchard, following that with the tillage of fruit lands, dealing with the planting and 
care of fruits. Taken all in all, it is the most complete book on fruit-growing at a 
small price we have seen." - western Rural.
