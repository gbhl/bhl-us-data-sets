Sunday, July 7, 1867.
  Clear and a beautiful
day 75 degrees, 82 degrees, 75 degrees.
Rose only in time for
breakfast. Attended
church and Sabbath
school as usual and
in the former suffered
much on account of
the heat. Read all the P.M.
till about 5.30 when
we took a ride through
Mt. Auburn and round
through Belmont and
Arlington. In the evening
R[uth] Deane came down and
we had a 'long talk'. The
gooseberries are getting quite
ripe and the white cherries
are at their height.

into Boston with father

was conditioned. Father
