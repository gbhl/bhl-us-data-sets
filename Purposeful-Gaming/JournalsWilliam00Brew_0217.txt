1889
Feb. 6
Enterprise, Florida
Cloudy and cold with north wind.
  Started off at 9.30 A. M. to hunt Quail taking
with us a young man from Sanford who came
over by appointment to show us his dogs. He
brought two, a setter and a liver & white ticked
pointer, both bitches. Mr. Cory also had his brace
of setters.
  As usual Prince, the black Gordon, found the
first bevy but the pointer was close behind him
and flushed the birds before we got within range
this disgusted C. who at once took up his dogs
and started back hunting a little by the way,
finding four bevies from which he bagged thirteen
birds.
  I kept on with the Sanford man and we
also found four bevies from which I killed nineteen
and my companion two Quail. I made two doubles
and missed only three birds. The dogs worked
very well especially the pointer but neither was
staunch or well broken. Four quail, during the day,
took to trees, one alighting in a tall pine near
the top the other three in low black jack oaks.
At the first bird I fired three shots aiming about
three feet to one side hoping to make him
fly but in vain for we had to finally leave
him there. The other three we started by 
throwing up sticks and I shot two, missing
the third.
  We saw one White Heron (A. egretta), a
single Hylotomus pileatus (said to be rare here
now) and several larger flocks of Quis. major
