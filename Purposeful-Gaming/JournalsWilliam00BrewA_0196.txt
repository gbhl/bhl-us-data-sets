and most of the waves were white'-'capped. Semat[?]
came tumbling over the canoe but my rubber apron
kept the water out and I reached the town without
shipping now than a tumble or so of water.
  at 4 P.M. I started on another trip. This him[?] in
company with Mr. Mansfield the orthodox clergyman
of the place. The [?] quickly and easily up the harbor
before a fresh breeze and passing Katarma turned in
at the entrance to the herring ditch a narrow channel
1Â¼ mile long dry across the plains last winter to
form a fish way with Great South Pound. Through this
ditch we dragged, trawed or paddled our boats, according
to the depth of water which varied from 2 to 20 meters,
disturbing several Kingfishers and Night Herons which
were perched along the Banks. We reached the pond
at 7 P.M. and after getting some[?] milk at a farm house
started across or up the pond a little after sunset. The
wind, although faint, still favoring us and permitting
the use of our sails.
  It was a delightful evening &[and] there were many interesting
birds. Night Herons in great numbers flying about or blarething[?]
in rows along the shores, flocks of Black Ducks, the going not
as yet strong of wing, fluttering out from the beds of Tan
Beeds, Wilsons & Least Terns, Piping Ploni, Spotted Sandpipers,
and "Peep" skimming arm[?] the water in wrong direction, and
a great bed of Paryn Gulls settled aridentty  for the night,
on a band for near [?] [?] shorn[?]. I switch up
to [?] Gulls & started then when to my surprise
I found that the greater number were L. marinum
several (at least two) fin adrift birds among them.
He landed about 2 miles up the pond, disturbing
a perfect cloud of Night Herons, and camped on The Beach
between the pond & the sea.
