1886
June 8
  Clear and cool. A fine day, moved only by a high
N.W. wind.
  Spent the morning on the east ground, starting 
on the Sandy Pond road and walking through the woods
to the turnpike and beyond the Hall's. Birds scarce and
not singing freely. Flushed a Grouse and shot a Hens-
[?] Bunting in an upland cloverfield where it was
singing on a weed stalk. Had a curious adventure
with a woodchuck. He was digging a [?] hole and
was buried only to his hind quarters. I approached
cautiously and actually poked his stem with my pistol,
He backed out, and for a moment stood motionless at
my feed stupified by surprise, then he made a bold
for his refuge hole and disappeared . I also saw a
large black snake which "rattled"" loudly in some
dry leaves, vibrating his tail exactly like a real
rattle snake.
  In the afternoon sailed down river to 
Dakin's Hill.  Saw two Bitterns.
