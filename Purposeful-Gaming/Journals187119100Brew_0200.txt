1886
Sept.1
Concord, Massachusetts.
  Clear and cool with high N.W. wind.
  To Ripley's Hill and swamp at 9 A.M.
Nothing on the hill but a family of Chickadees.
The Swamp, also, was apparently nearly barren
of birds but this may have been roving to 
the high wind which tossed the branches about 
and made such a noise in the leaves that 
it was difficult to see or hear anything.
I however, found a little party of three
Water Thrushes, and also saw a Wilson's
Thrush and a Brown Thrashes.
  Disgusted at this sorry showing I returned
over the hill finding two Phoebus and a 
small Warbler, which I took to be a Nashville,
in the pitch pines.
  Talking my canoe I next paddled up 
the Assabet to Bird's-nest Id. opposite which
I landed and proceeded to explore the birch
swamp.  The wind was less boisterous then
but still it made collecting difficult. I 
found a single Red start and a small mixed flock
consisting of S. Lit[?], I ad. [male] Redstart, 3
Red-eyes, an Oven bird and two Black-poll Warblers; I
also saw 5 or 6 Water Thrushes, three of them
together on the ground.
  Along the river started tow Kingfishers
and saw a high Barn Swallow scaling
about in the wind.
  Snake's head in bloom along the
banks; also what I take to fringed
gentrium in bud, not yet open; pale blue.
