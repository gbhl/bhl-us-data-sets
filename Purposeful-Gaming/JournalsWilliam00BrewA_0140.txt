Concord to Wayland, Mass.
straight course for the Wayland bridge making the
entire distance under sail, close-hauled with a good breeze.
As the boat dashed through the tops of the tall grasses
and water plants it dislodged immense number of gauze-winged
insects which I took to be Ephemera of some species and which
annoyed us to crawling over our necks, faces & hands, faster
than we could brush them off. We started a pair of 
Wood Ducks about mid-way of the meadow and heard
a pair of musk-rats uttering their peculiar murmur.
Marsh Wrens began to be heard as we neared the bridge and
continued in increasing numbers through the meadow beyond
the second bridge to the town. Red-wings were scarce the
entire distance from Concord owing probably, to the high
stage of water. We heard no Bitterns until after passing the
first Wayland bridge and no Rails at all. 
  Just above the first bridge we landed and tried at
three houses to get accommodations for the night. No success
in this attempt but we were repaid by finding a large
colony of Eave Swallows nesting on the side of a farm
and hearing as well as seeing an immature Orchard Oriole
which was singing in a tall elm. 
  Continuing on we reached the upper bridge at sunset.
As we neared it an immense flock of Cedar Birds rose
from an orchard to the S. and mounting high in air
went off to the N. in a great straggling body which
covered an area of fully an acre. I counted eighty and
did not get them all at that. 
  We arranged to spend the night at Mr Dudley's, a 
new house near the bridge on a knoll commanding a
fine view of the river.
  Water buttercups in full bloom along the entire course of the
river in places forming solid beds of gold.
