544 VITALITY AND EFFICIENCY WITH RESTRICTED DIET. 
it is of very great importance to note that not only were these men 
able to walk 10 km. at a very much less expenditure of energy than 
prior to their diet restriction, but that per unit of work done the 
figures for the horizontal kilogrammeter constants distinctly imply an 
increase in efficiency. 
WALKING EXPERIMENTS WITH SQUAD A. 
Since only one series of experiments was made with Squad A and that 
on the last day of diet restriction, the basal values for this group of 
subjects prior to diet restriction are lacking. We must accordingly 
rely for controls first upon the series with Squad B on full diet, and 
second, so far as necessary, upon the series of observations made 
upon normals in the Nutrition Laboratory. 
Such a comparison may reasonably be made, for, in the first place, 
with Squads A and B we are dealing with similar groups of men; second, 
the average nude weight of the individuals in the two squads differed 
but 1 kg. from each other. The men were of reasonably uniform age, 
and represent homogeneous material drawn from the college body. In 
other words, the average body-weight and general condition of Squads 
A and B were essentially the same prior to the reduction in diet, so that 
any change in metabolism of Squad A as a whole may not illogically be 
compared to the normal values for Squad B. Attention should, how- 
ever, be called to the fact that Squad B did exhibit apparently a seasonal 
variation, as pointed out in an earlier section. We are hereby assum- 
ing that the same seasonal variation would have been shown by Squad 
A; in other words, that the basal metabolism of Squad A would be as 
low as that of Squad B. 
The preliminary standing tests with Squad A have been previously 
discussed; the data which are used for the computation of the incre- 
ments are drawn from table 137. 
The metabolism measurements and the computations for the heat 
during walking have been summarized for all the members of Squad A 
in table 142. The uniformity in distance walked is here again shown. 
The respiratory quotients, with three exceptions. Gar, Gul, and 
Tom, are not far from those to be expected from men on the character 
of the diet employed. It seems quite clear that the quotients over 0.90 
are not correct. It may or may not be significant that two of these 
high values, 0.89 and 0.93, are associated with the lowest horizontal 
kilogrammeter factors. We see no reason, however, for excluding 
these values from the averages. The total heat (column h) repre- 
sents reasonably close conformity with the body-weight. The total 
heat required in walking 10 km., as recorded in the last column, shows 
the average for this squad is 484 calories. The actual amount of work 
performed is given in column d, from which the heat output on the unit 
basis of a horizontal kilogrammeter is obtained (column k). These
